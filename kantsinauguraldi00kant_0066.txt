spaces are only parts of the same immense space mutually
related by certain posstions, nor can you conceive of a cubic
foot except as being bounded in all directions by surround-
ing space.

C. Τ lte concept of space, therefore, is a pure z'ntuition, being
a singular concept, not made up by sensations, but itself the
fundamental form of all external sensation. This pure intui--
tion is in fact easily perceived in geometrical axioms, and
any mental construction of postulates or even problems.
That in space there are no more than three dimensions, that
between two points there is but one strainght line, that in 3
plane suriac'e from 3 given point with a given right line 3
circle is describable‚ are not conclusions from some universal
notion of space, but only discernz'ble in space as in the con-
crete. Which things in a given space lie toward one side
and which are turned toward the other can by no acuteness
of reasoning be described discursively or reduced to intel-
lectual marks. There being in perfectly similar and equal
but incongruous solids, such as the right and the left hand,
conceived of solely as to extent, or spherical triangles in op-
posite hemispheres, a difference rendering impossible the co-
incidence of their limits of extension, although for all that
can be stated in marks intelligible to the mind by speech
they are interchangeable, it is patent that only by pure in-
tuition can the difference, namely, incongruity, be noticed.
Geometry, therefore, uses principles not only undoubted and
discursive but falling under the mental view, and the obvious-
ness of its demonstrations—which means the clearness of
certain cognition in as far as assimilated to sensual know-
ledge—is not only greatest, but the only one which is given
in the pure sciences, and the exemplar and medium of all
obvz‘ousness in the others. For, since geometry considers the
relations of space, the concept of which contains the very
form of all sensual intuition, nothing that is perceived by the
