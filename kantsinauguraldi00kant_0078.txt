hence will square well enough with the subject of a judgment
whose concept is also sensuous. But if it be applied to an
intellectual concept, the judgment will be valid only accord—
ing to subjective laws, and hence must not be affirmed ob—
jectively and predicatcd of the intellectual notion itself, but
only as a candidiore in tlte absence os wlciclc tlte sensuous cog—
nition of tlce given concept does not take place.¹
Now, since the tricks of the intellect by the subordination
of sensuous concepts as though intellectual marks may be
called, analogously to the accepted meaning, a fallacy of
subreptz‘on, the exchanging of intellectual and sensual con-
cepts will be a metaplcysz'cal fallacy of subreption, the intel-
lectualz'zed plzcnomcnon, if the barbarous expression be per-
missible, and hence I call such a lzybrz’d axiom as palms off
Vlthe sensuous as necessarily adhering to the intellectual con-
cept, a surreptitz'ous axz'om. From these spurious axioms
have gone forth, and are rife throughout metaphysics, prin-
ciples deceiving the intellect. In order that we may have,
however, a readily and clearly knowable citerion of those
judgments‚ a touchstone, so to speak, by which to distinguish
them from genuine judgments, and at the same time if,
perhaps, they seem to cling tenaciously to the intellect, an

¹ The use of this criterion is fruitful and easy in distinguishing principles which
enunciate laws of sensuous cognition only from those prescribing besides some-
thing concerning the objects themselves. Is the predicate be an intellectual con-
cept, its reference to the subject of the judgment, though this subject be thought
of as an object of sense, always denotes a mark belonging to the object itself.
Istlze predicate be α sensuous concept, then, since the laws of sensuous cognition
are not conditions of the possibility of things themselves, it is not valid as to the
subject of the judgment concez'ved intelleclually, and hence it cannot be enounced
objectively. Thus in the common axiom whatever exists is somewhre, as the
predicate contains conditions of sensuous knowledge it cannot be enouneed as to
the subject os the judgment, namely, anything existing, generally: hence this
formula as an objective rule is salse. But converting the proposition, so as to
make the predicate an intellectual concept, it becomes perfectly true: thus:
whatever is somewhere, exists.
