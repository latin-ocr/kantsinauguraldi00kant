the moment of presence of the movable point at the same
vertex b, considered as moving in the same direction bc.
But between two moments there is time; therefore, the
movable point is present at point b for some time, that is, it
rests. Therefore it does not move continuously, which is
contrary to the assumption. The same demonstration is
valid for motion over any right lines including an assignable
angle. Hence a body does not change its direction in con-
tinuous motion except by following a line no part of which
is straight, that is, a curve, as Leibnitz maintained.

5. Time is not something olgjcctz've and real, neither a sub-
stance, nor an accident, nor a relation. ' It is the subjective
condition necessary by the nature of the human mind for co-
ordinating any sensible objects among themselves by a cer-
tain law3 time is a pure z'ntm'z‘ion. Substances as well as
accidents we co-ordinate whether according to simultaneity
or succession by the concept only of tirne; hence the notion
of time as the principle of form outranks the concepts of the
former. Any relations so far as occurring in sense-percep-
tion, whether simultaneous or successive, involve nothing but
the determination of positions in time, to wit, either in the
same point or in different points of the latter.

Those who assert the objective reality os time either con—
ceive of it as a continuous How in what exists, without, how-
ever, any existing thing, as is done especially by the English
philosophers, an absurd fiction, or as something real ab-
stracted from the succession of inner states, as it has been
put by Leibnitz and his followers. The falsity of the latter
opinion, besides obviously exposing it to the vicious circle
in the definition of time, and, moreover, plainly neglecting
simultanez‘ty, the most important consequence of time, dis-
turbs all sound reason, because it demands instead of the
determining of the laws of motion by the measure of time,
that time itself, as to its nature, be determined by what is
