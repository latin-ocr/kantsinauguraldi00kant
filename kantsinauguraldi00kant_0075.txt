world only an ideal whole. To me the former, though not
demonstrated‚ appears abundantly proved by other reasons.

If it were right to overstep a little the limits of apodictic
certainty befitting metaphysics, it would seem worth while to
trace out some things pertaining not merely to the laws but
even to the causes of sensuous intuition, which are only intel-
lectually knowable. Of course the human mind is not af—
fected by external things, and the world does not lie open to
its insight infinitely, except as far as itself together with all
other things z's sustaz‘ned by tlze same infinite power of one.
Hence it does not perceive external things but by the pres-
ence of the same common sustaining cause; and hence space,
which is the universal and necessary condition of the joint
presence of everything known sensuously, may be called the
phenomenal 07727zz'p7'esence, for the cause of the universe is not
present to all things and everything, as being in their places,
but their places, that is the relations of the substances, are pos-
sible, because it is intimately present to all. Furthermore,
since the possibility of the changes and successions of all things
whose principle as far as sensuously known resides 'in the con-
cept of time, supposes the continuous existence of the subject
whose opposite states succeed3 that whose states are in flux,
lasting not, however, unless sustained by another; the con-
cept of time as one infiniteand immutable in which all things
are and last, is the plzenbmenal etcrm'ty of the general cause.¹
But it seems more cautious to hug the shore of the cogni-
tions granted to us by the mediocrity of our intellect than to

1The moments of time do not appear to follow one another, since if they did
another time would have to be premised for the succession of moments3 but by
sensuous intuition the actual things appear to descend, as it were, through a con-
tinuous series of moments.
