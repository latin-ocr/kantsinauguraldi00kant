real use. By the second use they, whencesoever given, are
'merely by common marks subordinated to one another, the
lower to the higher, and compared among themselves ac-
cording to the principle of contradiction. This is calleci the
logical use. The logical use of the intellect is common to all
the sciences3 the real use is not. For a cognition given in
any wise is regarded either as contained under or as opposed
to a mark common to several cognitions, and this either by
immediate apposition, as in jndgmcnts in order to distinct
cognition, or mediately, as in rcasoning, in order to adequate
cognition. Thus sensuous knowledge being given, sensuous
percepts are by the logical use of the intellect subordinated
to other sensuous percepts‚ as to common concepts, and
phenomena to the more general laws of phenomena. In this
connection it is of the greatest moment to note that cogni-
tions must continue to be regarded as sensuou5‚ no matter

⁴ how great may have been the logical use of the intellect

upon them. For they are called sensuous on account of tg'ggz'r
orzgz‘n, not of their collation by identity and opposition.
Hehce, empirical laws, though oi the greatest generality, are,
nevertheless, sensual, and the principles of sensuous form in
geometry‚ the relations in determinate space, however much
the intellect arguing according to logical rules from what is
sensuously given, by pure intuition, be employed upon them,
do not for that matter pass beyond the class of sense-
percepts. That in sense—percepts and phenomena which
precedes the logical use of the intellect is called appearance,
while the reflex knowledge originating from several appear-
ances compared by the intellectis called experz'euce. Thus
there is no way from appearance to experience except by
reflection according to the logical use of the intellect. The
ι’ common concepts of experience are termed empirz'cal, its
objects plcenomena, and the laws as well of experience as of
all sensuous cognition generally are called the laws of phe-
