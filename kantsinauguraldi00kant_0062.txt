parts. But since by time are only thought relations without
any mutually related data, there is in time—as a quantity—
composition, which being conceived wholly removed leaves
nothing over. But a composite of which, composition
being removed, nothing is left, does not c'onsist of simple
parts. Therefore‚ etc. Any part of time, then, is time;
and the simple things in time, namely, the moments, are not
parts of it, but termini between which time intervenes. For
two moments being given, time is not given, except as in
them actualities succeed each other; hence, beside the
given moment it is necessary that time be given in the latter
part of which there is another moment.

The metaphysica] law of continuity is this: All changes
are continuom or flowing, that is, opposite states succeed
each other only by an intermediate series of different states,
For since two opposite states are in different moments of
time, and some time is always intercepted between two mo-
ments, in which infinite series of moments the substance is
neither in one assignable state nor the other, nor yet in
none, it will be in different states, and so on infinitely.

The celebrated Kastner‚ calling in question this Leibnitzian
law,¹ calls on its defenders to demonstrate that the continu-
ous motion of a point around tlce sides osa triangle is impos-
sible, it being necessary to prove this if the law of continuity
be granted. Here is the demonstration required. Let the
letters a b c denote the three angular points of a rectilineal
triangle. If the point did move continuously over the lines
ab, bc, ca, that is, over the perimeter of the figure, it would
be necessary for it to move at the point b in the direction
ab, and also at the same point b in the direction bc. These
motions being diverse, they cannot be simultaneous. There-
fore, the moment of presence of the movable point at vertex
b, considered as moving in the direction ab, is different from
