1 71] KANT’S [ΝΑ UG URAL DISSER TA TJON OF 1770 93

Reason still follows its own course in its empirical, and
again a peculiar course in its transcendental use,l and Kant
keeps us in mind of the Dissertational origin of his idea of
the transcendental use of reason by saying: Whatever in an
object of the senses is not in itself phenomenal, I call intel-

elaborations, that is, get rid of the Erliluterung above re-

nection with the Dissertation has been illustrated. Kant’s
Anmerkung zur An1phibolie der Reflexionsbegriffe‚ by its
cogent, logical and historical presentation‚ will not only set

true import of the two parts of the Critique, which it con-
