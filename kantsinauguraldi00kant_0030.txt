following citations are merely illustrative. Space, repre-
sented as an object, as we actually need to do in geometry,
contains more than the mere form of intuition, namely, a
synthesis of the manifold. In the Aesthetic I enumerated it
merely under sensibility, though it presupposes a synthesis
not pertaining to the senses.¹ The synthesis of apprehension
which is empirical must necessarily conform to the synthesis
of apperception which is intellectual and contained wholly
a priori in the Category. It is one and the same spontaneity,
which in the former under the name of imagination‚ and in
the latter under the name of understanding, introduces con-
nection into the manifold intuition,² and it is not more
strange that the laws of natural phenomena must necessarily
agree with the understanding and its a priori form, that is,
its faculty of generally connecting the manifold, than that
the sensuous phenomena themselves must agree with the
a priori form of sensuous intuition. Phenomena do not
exist in themselves, but only relatively to the subject as far
as it has senses. Exactly so laws do not exist in the phe-
nomena, but only relatively to the subject in whom these
inhere.³

This synthesis constituting a single experience‚ one nature,
one sole unity of appercepti0n‚ is absent from the Disserta-
tion. This vindication of the laws of nature by unity of ap—
perception is far more than a reply to Hume, though a reply
to Hume none the less. It marks the introduction of a
principle foreign to all previous philosophy. This novel
idea of a synthesis by the spontaneous unity of apperception
sets the absolute limits to Hume's infiuence. In the Disser-
taz'z'on the skeptical influence was barely begun.
