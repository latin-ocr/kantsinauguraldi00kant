103] KANT’S [NA σε URAL DJSSER TA Tlolv OF 1770 2 5

ent direction to my investigations in the field of speculative
philosophy. Commencing from a well-founded, though not
elaborated, thought, one may fairly hope, by continued
reflection, to get on farther than the keen-witted man whom
one had to thank for the first light. Ι soon found that the
concept of cause and effect is far from being the only one by
which the understanding thinks a priori the connection of
things; but that, on the contrary, these concepts constitute
the whole of metaphysiCS. When from a single principleI
had succeeded in ascertaining their number, Ι went at deduc-
ing thern, being now assured that they were not, as Hume
had doubted, derived from experience, but from the pure
understanding.¹

To perceive the force of this confession as to Hume’s in-
fiuence on Kantian metaphysics it must be remembered that
Kant divided all contestants in the field into Naturalists and
Scientists. The first class includes the common sense con-
troverters of Hume, described thus: The naturalist of pure
reason lays down as his principle that more can be achieved
by means of common reason, without science, than through
speculation. It is as if one should maintain that the magni-
tude and distance of the moon can be better determined by
the naked eye than by a roundabout mathematical calcula-
tion. This is mere misology reduced to principles.² It is
plain that Kant did not need to be delivered from the Com-
mon Sense or Naturalist philosophers by Hume.

Those following a scientific method have the choice of pro-
ceeding either skeptz'cally or dogmatically.3 In Kantian
phraseology, dogmatism, therefore, applies both to the sen-
sualism of Locke and the rationalism of Leibnitz. The
awakening and directive power of Hume must be measured
upon this understanding of the term.
