which it appears easy and quick to the mind to make use oi
its insight. I shall beg leave to throw in here, by way of
conclusion, some mention of these principles, not as yet, as
far as I know, set forth distinctly. I call, then,princzj)les
of convenience rules oi judging to which we freely submit,
and to which we adhere as if they were axioms, for the only
reason that, were we to depart from sltem, scarcely any J'udg-
ment concerning a given object would be permissible to our
intellect. In this list belong the following: Fz'rst, that by
which we assume that everytlcz'ng in tlte universe is done ac-
cording to tlte order of nature, which principle by Epicurus
was proclaimed without any restriction, and by all other
philosophers unanimously with extremely rare exceptions‚
not to be admitted but from supreme necessity. Still we
thus affirm, not on account of possessing so ample a knowl-
edge of the events of the world according to the common
laws of nature, or because the impossibility or smaller hypo-
thetical possiblity of supernatural things is plain to us, but
because departing from the order of nature there would be
no use for the intellect, the rash citation of the supernatural
being the couch of lazy understandingS. For the same reason
we take care to shut out from the exposition of phenomena
comparative miracles, namely, the influence of spirits, since,
as we do not know their nature, the intellect, to its great
detriment, would be turned aside from the light ofexperience,
by which alone it is able to provide for itself laws of judging,
into the night of species and causes unknown to us. The
second is tlze partialz‘ty sor unity proper to the philosophical
mind, whence this wide—spread canon has flown forth: prin-
czples are not lo be nznltiplz'ed beyond supreme necessity, to
which we give in our adhesion‚ not because we have insight
into causal unity in the world either by reason or experience,
but as secking it by an impulse of the intellect which seems
to itself to have by thus much advanced in the explication of
