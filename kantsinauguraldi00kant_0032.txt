only. &Vere it to be valid of things, we should have to re-
gard evei-ything as consequent upon the existence of some-
thing else; the Sufficient Cause could be found nowhere.
From this absurdity refuge was taken in the proposition that
a thing may have the cause of its existence in itself; that it
may exist as a consequence of itself. But if the absurdity is
not to be obvious, this proposition again must be applied
not to things, but only to judgments, and to none but analyt—
ical judgments at that.¹

As to distinct and indistinct presentations, Leibnitz held
that the former mode, which Kant calls intuition merely, is
really a confused concept of the object. According to Leib-
nitz, eomequently, intuition is distinct from the concepts of
things, not specifically, but only in the degree of conscious-
ness. The intuition of a body would give in the continuous
consciousness of all the presentations contained in it, a con-
cept of the body as an aggregate of monads. In this way
the proposition: Bodies consist of monads‚ could arise from
experience merely by the analysis of the perception, provided
we could see sharply enough with an adequate consciousness
of the partial presentations².

This Leibnitzian view, Kant maintains, is not only sub-
versive of the apodictic certainty of mathematics but opposed
to geometrica] experience. The co-existence of these
monads is represented as possible in space only. The meta-
physician of the Leibnitzian school must admit that space is
merely the empirical and confused presentation of the co-
existence of the manifold externally to each other. If he
does, how can he assert the three dimensions of space as an
apodictic a priori proposition ? From the clearest con-
sciousness of all the partial presentations of a body he could
not get by analysis the necessity of that proposition. If he
assumes it as the necessary a priori foundation for every
