OF TIME

1 . lee idea of time does not originale 2⁰72, but z‘s presnpposed
by tlte senses. Whether things falling under sense-perception
be simultaneous or in line of succession cannot be repre-
sented but by the idea of time; nor does succession beget
the concept of time3 it appeals to it. Hence the notion of
time, though acquired by experience, is badly defined by a

later can be defined in no way by any marks conceivable by
the intellect, unless you are willing to run into a circle, and
the mind discerns it by no more than one intuition. Be-

4. Time z's a continuans quantity and the principle of the
laws of continuity in the changes of the universe. For a
continuans quantity is one which does not consist of simple
