26 KANT’S [NA (J'G (JRAL DISSER TA ‘l'lOiv OF 1770 [104

What has been said in reference to Locke and Kant is ap-
plicable to Kant and Hume. Through a certain range their
minds were profoundly similar. The following remarks of
Kant on Hume are just as true oi himself. Hume called this
destructive philosophy itself metaphysics, and attributed to
it great value. Metaphysics and morals, he says, are the
most important branches of science; mathematics and
natural science are not worth half as much. But in this pass-
age the acute man had reference only to the negative use,
which results from the moderation of the exaggerated claims
of speculative reason in removing the many endless and per-
secuting quarrels which confuse mankind.¹

Kant’s cardinal objection to Hume is: He lost out of sight
the damage arising from depriving reason of the most import-
ant outlooks in whose direction alone it can stake out to the
will the highest goal oi its endeavors.² That Hume obtained
no influence on the Praetical Philosophy of Kant is, there-
fore, plain. That his influence on the speculative Kantianism
was of the greatest moment is just as obvious. How far had
the latter influence gone when the Dissertation was written?
We shall venture a hypothesis.

The Dissertation consists oi two unequally developed
parts. What is said on the Sensible World is not far from
the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant’s long mathematical
training and the impact of Hume’s skepticism combined.

The rest of the Dz'ssertatz'on by comparison with the
Critique is immature. The war on spurious concepts in the
latter part of the Dissertation is in Hume's spirit, but skep-
ticism has not fully done its work. There are, to be sure,
other displacements of Leibnitzian notions‚ evidently due,
however, to Newtonian rather than Humean influences. In
