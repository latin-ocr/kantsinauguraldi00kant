cludcs, but shed a ssood of light on their relation to the Dis-
sertation. We have appropriated from it already the plea
for the term “ transcendental place,'' when confessing our in-
ability to be as certain as a writer whom we greatly respect
in reference to the particular origin of the Dissertation.
Kant says: For want of such a transcendental topic, and de-
ceived by the amphiboly of reflective concepts, the cele-
brated Leibnitz erected an z'ntellectual system of tlte world, or
believed at least that he knew the internal nature otthings by
comparing all objects by the understanding only and by the
abstract formal concepts of his mind. Comparing all things
with each other by means of concepts only, he naturally
found no other difference but those by which the understand-
ing distinguishes its'pure concepts from each other. The
conditions of sensuous intuition, which carry their own dif-
ferences, are not considered by him as original and inde-
pendent; for sensibility was with him a confused mode of
representation only, and not a separate source of representa-
tions. According to him, a phenomenon was the represen-
tation of the thing itself, though different, in its logical form,
from knowledge by means of the understanding, because the
phenomenon, in the ordinary absence of analysis, brings a
certain admixture of collateral representations into the con· >
cept of a thing which the understanding is able to separate.
In one word, Leibnitz intellectualz'zed phenomena, just as
Locke, according to his system of Nozzgony. if I may use
such an expression, scnsualized all concepts of the under-
standing, that is, represented them as nothing but empirical,
although abstract, reflective concepts. Instead of regarding
the understanding and sensibility as two totally distinct
sources of representation, which however can supply ob-

each other, each of these great men recognized but one of
them. This one, in their opinion, applied immediately to
