nant with sound scientific suggestions on several geological
and meteorological subjects, besides lecturing regularly on
geography and anthropology, one realizes that his astrono-
mical performance, a significent scientific work, is merely the
most salient point of an activity in natural science in accord
with the most advanced thoughts of his day, and what is still
better, vivified by original reflection and the genuinely scien-
tific spirit. 11 much of it is obsolete, as the theory of im-

But his scientific status is discipleship to Newton. Space,
as the presupposition to the existence of bodies, is to him
axiomatic; within space and time the existence of motions‚
the exponents of forces, is a sels-evidencing postulate.

He clearly conceived the idea of applying this fertile
