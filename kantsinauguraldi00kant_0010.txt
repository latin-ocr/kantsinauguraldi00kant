the dimsealms of spiritism and table-rapping, all is religious
ferment.

That modern ethics is deeply influenced by the so-called
conflict between religion and seience little argument is
needed to establish. Beginning from few and losty in-
tellects. new lights are carried down to the lower ranges of
humanity, dimmed, obscured, but only the more disquieting.
In spite of science and the old—line ethics, using sometimes
as speaking-tubes the ancient creeds, often thrusting them
fiercely aside, there is rising again from the deep of human
hearts, the cry to the unspeakable depth of the Absolute
Fatherhood.

And not less than the speculative, moral, and religious
are the practical involutions. The masses are ripening for
a social, as toward the end of the eighteenth century they„
were rising for a political, revolution. It is the part of a fool
to deprecate a coming revolution. It is the part of the wise
to guide it. After hearing all the metaphysical explanations
for the Terreur of the French revolution in comparison with
Anglo-Saxon overturns‚ it occurs to one that it is easily
explicable. The latter were not in charge of madmen.
Locke was the guiding‚ steadying, controlling spirit over the
spirits of the men that controlled the American Revolution,
little as the influence of his writings—-the circulation of which
in the Colonies was comparatively immense—is suspected
by one school of writers on American history.

Ideas make facts; Platonic as the expressionvmay sound
in some ears, it is true, at all events, of historical facts. Is
not the whole program oi the nature-hatred and ecstatic
monkery of medieval history in a line of Augustine—“Nolz'
foras ire ‚· in te ipsum redi ‚· in interiore ltomz‘ne habitat
veritas ?”—Is not the French Revolution the carrying-out of
the Montesquieu program first, of the Rousseau program
