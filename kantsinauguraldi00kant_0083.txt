159] KANT’S [NA UGURAL DISSERTA TION OF 1770 81

In the same way, to the argument of llze intellect, proving
that a substantial composite being given so are the elements
of composition, that is, the simple things, there is adjoined a
supposititiam one suborned from sensual knowledge, namely,
that in such a composite there is not given an infinite regress
in the composition of the parts, that is to say, that in any
composite there is given a definite number of parts, a sense
certainly not germane to the former, and hence substituted
rashly for it. For that the quantity of the world is limsted,
not the maximum, that it owns a principle, that bodies con-
sist of simple parts, can certainly be cognized rationally.
But that the universe as to its mass is mathematically finite,
that its age as elapsed can be given by measure, that the
number ot simple parts constituting any body whatever is a
definite number, are propositions openly proclaiming their
origin from the nature of sensual knowledge; however true
they may be held to be, they bear the undoubted stigma of
their origin.

As for the latter spurious axiom, it originates from a rash
conversion of the principle of contradiction. For to this
primitive judgment the concept of time adheres to the extent
that contradictorily opposed data being given at [lle same
time in the same thing, the impossibility is plain, which is
enounced thus : whatever stimnltanconshs is and is not, z's im-
possible. Here, as the intellect predicates something in a case
given according to sensual laws, the judgment is perfectly
true and obvious. On the contrary, converting this axiom‚
saying: whatever is impossible is and is not al tlte same time,
or involves a contradiction, we predicate through sensual
knowledge something concerning the object oi reason gen-
erally, thus subjecting the intellectual conception of the pos-
sible and the impossible to the conditions of sensual knowl-
edge, namely, to the relations of time; which certainly is
true enough of the laws restricting and limiting the human
