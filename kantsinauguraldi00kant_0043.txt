Ι 19] KANT’S [ΝΑ UGURAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 41

with geometry. He is clear on the inadequacy of sense—per-
ception to furnish metaphysical knowledge. Those in pur-
suit of the phenomena of nature only are forever as far from
a recondite knowledge of first causes as he who by climbing
higher and higher toward a mountain-top should persuade
himself that he will at last hold the heavens in the hollow
palm of his hand.¹

The Leibnitzian Monadology, a species of enchanted
world, an assumption to which the celebrated man was se-
duced by taking sense-presentations considered as phe-
nomena, 'not as one should for a species of presentation en-
tirely distinct from concepts, to wit, for intuition. but for a
merely confused cognition by concepts,² is now completely
disestablished in Kant's mind. Its place we find taken by
the physical monad. A physical element or monad not only
is in space, but fills space.3 The monad defines the space of
its presence by the sphere of the activity by which it re—
strains the closer approach of the monads which are in turn
present to it externally.4 The force by which a simple
physical element occupies its space is the mutually applied
force of impenetrability in several elements.5 But by the
force of impenetrability alone bodies would not have definite
volume. There is needed the equally inherent force of at-
traction. Both together define the limit of extension.⁶

Descartes‚ the founder of modern metaphysics, was, by type
of mind, mathematical. Leibnitz, the inventor of the Dif-
ferential Calculus, was not less eminent as a mathematician
than as a metaphysician. By Spinoza the mathematical form
in metaphysical disquisition was carried to the last extreme.
After such antecedents, the Wolfian school might be excused
for believing that the mathematical mode of procedure was
the best expository method in philosophy.
