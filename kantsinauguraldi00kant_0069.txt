those prescribed by it, since in the fiction he would be com—
pelled to employ the aid of this very same concept, geometry
could not be used very safely in natural philosophy, For it
might be doubted whether this same notion drawn from ex—
perience would agree sufficiently with nature, the determina-
tions from which it was abstracted being, perchance‚ denied,
a suspicion of which has entered some minds already. Space,
then, is the absolutely first formal principle of tlie sensible
world, not only because by its concept the objects of the
universe can be phenomena, but especially for the reason
that it is, essentially but one, comprising all externally sen-
sible things whatsoever3 and hence constitutes the principle
of the universe, that is, of that whole which cannot be the
part of another.

COROLLARY

Here, then, are two principles of sensnons cogzzizjzffli, not, as
in intellectual knowledge, general concepts, but single and
nevertlieless pure intnition, in which the parts, and especially
the simple parts, do not, as the laws of reason prescribe, con-
tain the possibility of the composite, but, according to the
pattern of sensuous intuition, the infinite contains the reason
of the part, and finally of its thinkable simple part or rather
limit. For unless infinite space as well as infinite time be
given, no definite space and time is assignable by limitation,
and a point as well as a moment is unthinkable by itself and
only conceived in a space and time already given as the
limits. All primitive properties of these concepts are then
beyond the purview of reason, and hence cannot intellect-
ually be explained in any way. Nevertheless3 they are wlzat
nnderlies tlte intellect when from intuitive primary data it de-
rives consequences according to logical laws with the great-
est possible certainty. One ol these concepts properly con-
cerns the intuition of the object,· the other the state, especially
