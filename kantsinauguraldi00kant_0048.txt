culty generally feigns some objective repugnance and easily
deceives the incautious, the limits by which the human mind
is circumscribed being taken for those by which the essence
of things themselves is contained.

Furthermore, as the argument from intellectual reasonings
easily shows that substantial composites being given, whether
by the testimony of the senses or otherwise, the simple parts
and the world are also giggn, so does our definition point out
causes contained in the nature of the subject why the notion of
a world should not seem merely arbitrary and made up, as in
mathematics, only for the sake osthe deducible consequences.
The mind intent upon resolving as well as compouncling the
concept of a composite denQnds and presumes boundaries in
which it may acquiesce in the former as well as in the latter
direction.

Paragraplc 2

In defining the World the following points require atten-
tion:

I. Matter (in the transcendental sense), that is, the parts
which are here assumed to be subsgjqqnces. We might plainly
be regardless os coincidence between our definition and the
meaning of the common word, the question being, so to
speak, of a problem arising in accordance with the laws of
reasoning, namely, how several substances may coalesce into
one, and on what condition rests this one's being no part of
another. But the force of the word World, as commonly
used, of itself falls in with us. For no one will attribute
accz'dents to the World as parts, but as detemnz'natz'ons, states,-

called a W'orld, unless, perhaps, an imaginary qne. For the
same reason it is not permissible to refer the successive
