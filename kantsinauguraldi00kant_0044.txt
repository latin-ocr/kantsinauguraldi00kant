But Kant introduced his anuiry into tlze Evidentness os tlte
Principlcs of Natural leeology and M‘orals by claiming that
the question is such that, if properly solvcd, the solution will
give a definite form to higher philosophy. If the method
can be established by which the highest possible certainty in
this kind of cognition can be attained, and a thorough in-
sight is had into the nature of this knowledge, the everlast-
ing inconstancy of opinions and scholastic sects will be re-
placed by a method of teaching prescribed invariably, uniting
thoughtful minds to consonant endeavors‚ as Newton's
method in natural science changed the laxity of physical
hypotheses into a safe procedure in accordance with exper-
ience and geometry.¹

He proceeded to clear the road to the Critique by show—
ing that the entire method of philosophizing was wrong;
that the imitation of methematics was futile. For mathe-
matics obtains all its definitions synthetically, philosophy
analytically;‘' mathematics considers the universal under the
signs in the concrete, philosophy through the signs in the
abstract.²⁵ Hence philosophical certainty is of an altogether
different nature from mathematics.⁴

Continuing in this path he published only two years be-
fore the Dissertatz‘on a paper On tlte Fz’rst Ground of tlze Dzjf·
serence of Regions z'n Space. Here the transcendental nature
of space is reached at last. The argument containing the
illustration of the right and left hands, and of the spherical
triangles from opposite hemispheres, is taken over from this
essay into the Dz'ssertatz'on bodily.5

If the exposition has been lucid, we are probably prepared
to appreciate the Dissertation as a product of evolution.
