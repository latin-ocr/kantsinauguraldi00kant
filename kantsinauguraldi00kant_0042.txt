whole universe no onc thing is equal to any other thing, is
classificd even at this carly stage under Spurious Corollaries
from the Principle of the Detcrmining Cause—for Kant al-
ready refuses the term Sufficient Cause—as of illegitimate
derivation.¹

The Communion of Substanccs (lVeclzselwz'rkng) of the
Critique, it is worth distinctly cmphasizing, because its inser-
tion among the Categories has been held due to a love of
symmetry which in a work like the Critique would be simply
childish, is fully formulated even here, a quarter of a century
before the appearance of the Critique, as a principle, thus:
“ No change can happen to substances, except as connected
with others, their reciprocal dependence determining the
mutual alteration of state.² '' The very first application (usus)
of this alleged superfluous principle is directed against the
Idealists, the second completely subverts Leibnitz’s Pre-
Established Harmony by its own internal impossibility, Kant
laying claim to being the first to demonstrate that the co—ex-
istence of the substances oi the universe does not suffice to
establish their nexus.³

The historical origin of the Weckselwz'rkng as a Category
apart from causality is plain from the following utterance: It
is probable that gravitation is caused by the same nexus of
the substances by which they determine space and that it is
for this reason the most primitive law of nature, as is the
opinion of professed Newtonians. Among those qui se
Newtoni asseclas profitentur,⁴ Kant, of course, comprises
hims‘elf.

In his llffonadologz'a Physica Kant strove to point to the
employment in natural philosophy of metaphysics combined
