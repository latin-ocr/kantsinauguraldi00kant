Paragraplz I2

All sense-objects are phenomena, but that which, not
touching our senses, contains th'e form only of sensuality,
belongs to pure intuition, that is, an intuition devoid of sen-
sationS, but not on that account, intellectual. Phenomena of
the external sense are examined and set forth in pleysz‘cs,·
those of the internal sense in empirical psychology. But
pure human intuition is not a universal or logical concept
under wlzz'clc, but a singular z'n wlcz'clc al] sensible objects are
thought, and hence contains concepts of space and time, which,
since they determine nothing concerning sensible objects as
to quality, are not the objects of science except as to quantity.
Hence pure matlcematz‘cs considers space in geometry and
time in pure meclzam'cs. To these is to be added a certain
concept, intellectual to be sure in itself, but whose becoming
actual in the concrete requires the auxiliary notions of time
and space in the successive addition and simultaneous juxta-
position οἱ separate units‚ which is the concept of number
treated in arz'tlzmetz'c. Pure mathematics, then, expounding
the form of our entire sensuous cognition, is the organon of
all intuitive and distinct knowledge, and since its objects are
not only the formal principles of all intuition, but themselves
original intuitions, it coniers cognition both perfectly true,
and the model of the highest degree of clearness to otherS.
There is given, therefore, a science of sensual tlzz'ngs, though
being phenomena there is not given a rea-l intellection, but a
logica-l one only, hence it is plain in what sense those bor-
rowing from the Eleatic school are to be thought to have
denied a science oi phenomena.
