whether wc shall succeed better on the hypothesis that the
objects must conform to our cognition.¹

We thus assume concepts having an a priori reference to
objects. These concepts are neither empirical intuitions nor
pure intuitions. They are acts of pure thought.'·' The mind
of man carries order and regularity into the phenomena
which we call nature. If originally it had not placed them
there, it would never find them in nature.·² We thus form by
anticipation an idea of a science of the knowledge which be-
longs to the pure understanding and reason, and by which
we think objects entirely a priori. The science which de-
termines the origin, the extent, and the objective validity of
such knowledge may be called lranscendenlal logie.⁴

Of the understanding, various definitions have been given.
It has been called the spontaneity of knowledge—as opposed
to the receptivity of the senses—the faculty of thinking, of
concepts, of judgments. These explanations closely ex-
amined amount to the same. We may now characterize the
understanding as tlte faculty of rulesf’

Objective rules, necessarily inherent in our knowledge of
an object, are called laws. Although experience teaches us
many laws, yet these are only particular determinations of
higher laws. The highest among them, to which all others
are subject, spring a priori from the understanding. They
are not derived from experience, but, on the contrary, impart
to phenomena their regularity, and thus make experience
possible. The understanding therefore is not only a power
of making rules by a comparison of phenomena. It is itself '
the law-giver of nature. Without the understanding, nature,
that is, a synthetical unity of the manifold of phenomena ac—
cording to mles, would be nowhere to be found, as phe-
nomena cannot exist without υς, but only in our sensibility.⁶
