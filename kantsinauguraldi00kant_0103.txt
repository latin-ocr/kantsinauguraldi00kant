179] KANT’S [NA UGURAL DISSERTATJON OF 1770 101

De Mundi Sensz'bilz's et Intellzgibilz's might form the begin-
ning.'' We cannot conceive why Kant should have drawn
this line, unless he agreed with Mendelssohn and the present
writer. ’

One’s difficulty in thus conceiving is not fancifnl, but im-
plied in Kant’s repugnance to having “writings no longer
consonant with his present mode of thinking (Denkal‘t) ”¹
resurrected. The existence of the sentiment is none the less
but rather the stronger argument for being not confined to
Kant but a common one among men oi intellectnal sels-
respect. Feeling as Kant did, would he have drawn the line
as he did, if Windelband were right?
