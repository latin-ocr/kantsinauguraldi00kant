S. Tlee Nouvcanx Essais and tlte Dz'sserlatz'on

Of course this is to concede that the building-stones of the
Dissertation are by original extraction from the Leibnitzian
quarry. One may demur to locating the exact spot whence.

A recent worthy writer fixos upon the Nonvcanx Essaz's
sur l 'Entendemcnt Hnmain. Having outgrown the meta-
physics of the schools, Kant had long examined the theories
of the empiricists. They had not satisfied him. On the
contrary, his intent remaincd to find a new foundation for
metaphysics, and he followed Lambert's attempt to begin by
discriminating the form from the contentos cognition. Now,
the eternal truths were shown by Leibnitz to be virtually
contained in sensuous experience itself as involuntary forms
of relation, the reflection oi the understanding Setting them
forth into clear and distinct consciousness. This principle of
virtual innateness is the backbone of the Kantian Inaugural
Dissertation. The metaphysical truths lie in the soul as
laws of its activity, becoming functions on the occasion of
experience, and thus the object and the content of cognition
by the understanding.¹

The accent on “ virtual innateness'' is disputable. In his
letter of the 2d of September, 1770, sending the Dz'ssertatz‘on
to Lambert, Kant tells his correspondent: “About a year
since I attained that concept which I do not {ear ever to be
obliged to alter, though I may have to widen it, and by which
all sorts of metaphysical questions can be tested in accord-
ance with entirely safe and easy criteria, and a sure decision
reached as to whether they are solvable or insoluble. It
seems that metaphysics ought to be preceded by an especial,
though purely negative, science determining the validity and
limits of the principles of sensibility‚ in order that they may
not confuse the judgments concerning objects of pure reason.
