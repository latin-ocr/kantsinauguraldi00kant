later on? At present we need not sear the people, but
we do need to sear the sophist. This is the renaissanee of
the sophists. As in the time of Socrates, the old hold of
professed religions is being loosed, narrow pati-iotism is dis-
solving into individualism and cosmopolitanism, and a
physiological psychology is rampant on ground once re-

sophists is imperative.

To-day an individual Socrates is impossible. The disease

claim all that he can hold, the moralist sincere in his appeal
not to what man would but to what he should, the religionist
not clamorously affirming a chemical proof for God, Freedom,
and Immortality, but deep and strong enough to take it in
the imperative of the moral law and to see it foreshadowed
in the teleology of nature,-—each and every one will find his
impregnable Magna Charta in the Critiques of Kant.

And if we must have 3 revolutionary program, what safer,
since of the nature of the Social Contract it must be—what
especially safer for us, whose independence as 3 nation is 3
vindication of Locke, the Rousseauist before Rousseau—
than the sublimated Rousseauism of Kant? A nation sub-
stantially free does not reform by fire-brand. Truly as
beautifully says Bluntschli: “Rousseau carried the wildly-
flaming torch through street and market—place; Kant in 3
thousand studies lighted the quiet lamps and candles.”1

We shall, by going back to Kant, lose nothing that is
worth keeping of Hegel, of Schelling, of Fichte, or of Kant
himself, and we shall get a good deal more than we have
ever yet done out of the much-neglected Herbart, on whom
we depend after all for the evolution of a philosophy of
pedagogy.

But whether we gain or lose by going back to Kant, there
