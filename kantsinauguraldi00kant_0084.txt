intellect, but cannot be conceded objectively and generally
by any means. Of course, our intellects‘erccives no impossi-
bilior except where it can note the simultaneous enunciation
of oppositos concerning the sanie thing, that is, only where
contradiction occurs. VVhereven therefore, this contradic-
tion does not occur, there is no room for the judgment of
impossibility by the human intellect. But that on this ac-
count it should be open to no intellect whatever, and hence
that what does not involve contradiction is therefore possible,
is concluded rashly by taking the subjective conditions of
judgment for obJective ones. It is for this reason that a host
of fictitious forces, gotten up ad libitum, burstS, in the ab·
sence of sels-contradiction, from any constructive, or, if you
prefer, from every chimerical mind. For as a force is noth-
ing but a relation of a substance a to something else b, an
accident, as of a reason to the consequence, the possibility
of any force does not rest in the identity of the cause and the
effect, or the substance and the accident, and hence even the
impossibility of forces made up falsely does not depend solely
on contradiction. Therefore it is not permissible to assume
as possible any originalforce unless the force be given hy ex-
perience. Neither can the possibility be conceived a priori
by any perspicacity of the intellect.

The spurious axioms of the third kind from conditions
proper to the subject whence they are transferred rashly to
the object are plentiful, not, as in those of the Second Class,
because the only way to the intellectual concept lies through
the sensaous data, but because only by aid of the latter can
the concept be applied to that which is given by experience,
that is, can we know whether something is contained under
a certain intellectual concept or not. To this class belongs
the threadbare one of the schools: whatever exists con-
tingently does at some time not exist. This spurious principle
