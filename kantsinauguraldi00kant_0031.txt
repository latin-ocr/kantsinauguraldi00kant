How is experience possible ?—Space and time subjectively
considered are forms of sensibility. But to form a concept
of them as objects of pure intuition—without doing which
we could say nothing of them—requires apriom' the concept
of a compound. This requires the concept of a synthesis of
the manifold. It consequently requires the synthetic unity
of apperception in connecting this manifold. But this unity
of consciousness by reason of the difference of intuitive pre-
sentations of objects in space and time needs different func-
tions in order to connect them. These fonctions are termed
Categories, and are apriorz' concepts of the understanding.
They do not of themselves alone form the foundation for the
general knowledge of an object, but they do for the cogni-
tion of an object given in empirical intuition. This cogni-
tion when obtained is experience. The empirical, that by
which an object is given as existing‚ is termed sensation or
impression, constituting the matter os experience; called,
when connected with conscionsness, perception. To this
must be added the form, that is to say, the synthetic unity of

apperception in the understanding, in order to produce exper-
ience as empirical knowledge.¹

The Leibnitz-Wolffian philosophy was elaborated in the
belief that in addition to the Aristotelian law of Contradiction
it had given philosophers a new test, the Law of Sufficient
Cause, for the existence of things as distinct from their con-
ceptual possibility, and the proposition of the difference be-
tween confused and distinct presentation as a discriminative
test of intuition from conceptual knowledge.

With all this elaboration, it unwittingly remained in the
field of logie. It took not one step forward towards meta-
physics‚ let alone in metaphysics. The proposition: Every-
thing is a consequence, can belong, as far as it goes, to logic
