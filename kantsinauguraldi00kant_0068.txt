For, not to enlarge upon the obvious circle in which they
become involved in defining space, they cast forth geometry,
thrown down from the pinnacle of certitudo, into the number
of those sciences whose principles are empirical. If we have
obtained all the properties of space by experience from ex-
ternal relations only, geometrical axioms have only compar·
ative universalsty, such as is acquired by induction. They
have universality evident as far as observed, but neither
necessity, except as far as the laws of nature may be estab-
lished, nor precision, except what is arbitrarily made. There
is hope, as in empirical sciences, that a space may some time
be discovered endowed with other primary properties, per-
chance even a rectilinear figure of two lines.

E. Though the conceptos space as an objective and real
thing or quality is imaginary, it is nevertheless in respect to
all sensible tlcz'ngs not only pmfectly fruc, it is the foundation
of truth in external sensibility. Things cannot appear to the
senses under any form but by means of a power of the soul
co—ordinating all sensations in accordance with a fixed law
implanted in its nature. Since, therefore, nothing at all can
be given the senses except conformably to the primary
axioms of space and their consequences which are taught by
geometry, though their principle be but subjective, yet the
soul will necessarily agree with them, since to this extent it
agrees with itself; and the laws of sensuality will be the laws
of nature sofar as z't can be perccz‘vcd by our scnscs. Nature,
therefore, is subject with absolute precision to all the pre-
cepts of geometry as to all the properties of space there de-
monstrated, this being the subjective condition, not hypo-
thetically but intuitively given, of every phenomenon in
which nature can ever be revealed to the senses. Surely,
unless the concept of space were originally given by the na—
ture of the mind, so as to cause him to toil in vain who
should labor to fashion mentally any relations other than
