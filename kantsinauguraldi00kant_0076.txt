ΟΝ THE METHOD RESPECTING THE SENSUOUS AND THE
INTELLECTUAL IN METAI’HYSICS

Paragraplc 2 3

In all sciences whose principles are given intuitively,
whether by sensual intuition, that is, experience, or by an
intuition sensuouS, to be sure, but pure—the concepts of
space, time, and number—that is to say, in the natural and
in the mathematical sciences, use gives method, and by trying
and finding after the science has been carried to some degree
of copiousness and consonancy it appears by what method
and in what direction we must proceed in order to finish and
to purity it by removing the defects of error as well as of
confused thoughts3 exactly as grammar after the rnore copi-
ous use of speech, and style after the appearance oi choice
examples in poetry and oratory,fur11ished vantage—ground
to rules and to discipline. But the use of llce intellect in the
sciences whose primitive concepts as well as axioms are
given by sensuous intuition is only logical, that is, by it we
only subordinate cognitions to one another according to
their ·relative universality conformably to the principle of
contradiction, phenomena to more general phenomena, and
consequences of pure intuition to intuitive axioms. But in
pure philosophy, such as metaphysics, in which the use of
tlte intellect in respect to principles is real, that is to say,
where the primary concept of things and relations and the
very axioms are given originally by the pure intellect itself,
