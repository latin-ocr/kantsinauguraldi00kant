167] KANT’S [NA UGURAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 89

That is to say, Kant emphasizes the principles of the form of
the sensible world,l and their discrimination from noumena²
in the method of metaphysics.³ We accordingly find that,
roughly speaking, Section ΙΙΙ enters into the Critique as the
Transcendental Aesthetics, while Sections ΙΙ and V form
the ground-smel< of Transcendental Analytics, the unem-
phasized First and Fourth sections containing the scattered
seeds os the Transcendental Dialectics.

The number of these germs is apt to be under-estimated.
We shall intimate a few.

In the teeth of Mendelssohn's objection the implication of
time in the Principle of Contradiction is retained in the defi-
nition of change and the accidental. In the pure sense of
the Categories we call contingent that of which the contra-
dictory opposite is possible. Of what undergoes change we
may say that the opposite of its state is real—and therefore
possible also—at another time.⁴

Kant continues to hold that we can discover no sign of
contingency except something happem‘ng‚ that is, the exist-
ence preceded by the non-existence of the object.5

The proposition that the world must have a beginning in
time, is still classified as a transcendental illusione

The remainder turns up again that there exist in our
reason considered subjectively as a faculty oi human knowl-
edge principles and maxims of its use, which have the ap-
pearance oi objective principles and lead us to mistake the
subjective necessity of a certain connection of our concepts
in favor of the understanding for an objective necessity in-
herent in the determination of things themselves.7

, Occasionally we have a curious shifting in the terminology,
