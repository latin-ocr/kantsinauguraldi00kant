As to the field oi hypotheses, if the faculty of imagination
is not simply to indulge in dreams, but to invent and com-
pose under the strict surveillance of reason, it is necessary
that there should always be something perfectly certain, and
not only invented or testing on opinion, and that is the pos-
sibility of the object itself. If that is given, it is then allow-
able, sofar as its reality is concerned, to have recourse to
ophuonst

This opinion, however, if it is not to be utterly groundless,
must be brought in connection with what is really given, and,
therefore, certain as its ground of explanation.'²

This principle of complete determination relates to the
content and not only to the logical form.³

According to this principle, therefore, everything is re-
ferred to a common correlate, that is, to the total possibility
which, could it, the matter for all possible predicates, be
found in the idea of any single thing, would prove an affinity
of all possible things, through the identity of the ground of
complete determination.4

Here we reach again one of these re-adjustments oi
thought so interesting to observe in the development of the
Critique from the Dissertation.

We take the idea of supreme wisdom for our rule in the
investigation of nature, and for the principle of its systemati—
cal and well-planned unity according to general laws, even
when we are not able to perceive that unity.⁵

In other words, it must be the same to you, wherever you
perceive it, whether you say, God has wisely willed it so, or
nature has wisely arranged it so.⁰

The sophisma figurae dictionis is shown up in the para-
logism of rational psychology and in the Cosmological con-
flict.⁷
