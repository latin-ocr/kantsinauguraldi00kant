truth transcendental. It afseets not only the form, as more
or less confused, but the origin and contents. By our sensi-
bility we do not know the nature of things confusedly. We
clo not know it at all. Apart from our subjective condition,
the object, as represented and qualified by our sensibility, is
nowhere to be found. It cannot possibly be found, since its
form, as phenomenal appearance, is determined by those
very subjective conditions.¹ This intuition is aprz'orz' in us.
It is in us before any perception of an object.²

How can an external intuition preceding the objects take
place in the mind, and how can it a priori determine the ob—
J‘ects? Obviously it can do so only by inhering in the sub—
ject as its formal capacity for being affected by objects so
as to obtain an immediate presentation or intuition of the
same. In other words, it can only do so by being the gen-
eral form of the external sense of the subJect„³

Why did Kant place himself in strenuous opposition to
Leibnitz at so vital a point? The reply can be put into a
single sentence: Our explanation alone renders comprehen-
sible the possibility of geometry considered as a synthetic
a priori cognition.⁴

An equally good apriorz‘ basis for number is furnished by
Kant's metaphysical treatment of time. The pure image of
all quantities for the external sense is space. The pure
image of all objects of sense, generally, is time. Now, the
pure schema for quantity, regarded as a concept of the
understanding‚ is number. Number is a presentation com-
prising the successive addition of homogeneous units. Num-
ber, therefore, is simply unity in the synthesis of the manifold
in a homogeneous intuition accomplished by my generating
time itself while apprehending my intuition.⁵
