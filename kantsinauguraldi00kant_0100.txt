within the silent decade. If we are, then Kant, having en-
tered the right road, plodded silently on in the direction
indicated by the Dissertation as a guide-post till he reached
the goal, the Critique of Pure Reason. In other words, if we
are right, the Dissertation is the beginning of the end, though
the end be afar off. It is the beginning of the Critical per-
iod. If we are not, it is the Pre-Critical. The Critical period
begins somewhere else, and that somewhere else is later on.

We have been obliged to withhold assent from a very re-
spectable position on the Dissertation. We are on the pres-
ent occasion constrained, reluctantly, for a man of Professor
WVindelband's soberness and solidity of judgment is not
rashly to be differed with, to cite Dr. &Vindelband adversa-
tively to Kant and leave the matter to the decision of the
reader.

According to WVhrdelband, the system set forth in the
Dis-sertatim was promptly given up again, and, therefore,
belongs to the Pre-Critical period. The doctrine presented
with an appeal to Malebranche in Section IV is precisely the
system of preformed harmony between cognition and reality
which Kant so energetically rejects in his letter of the zlst
of February, 1772, to Marcus Herz.¹

The appeal to Malebranche does not seem to us very vig-
orous.‘² It is serni-deprecatory and wears the appearance
rather of an obiter dictum than of an argument which the
writer intends to take his stand on. It is unnecessary to
insist on the fact that the passage in the letter to Hei-z refers
to Crusius and not, as Windelband intimates, to Malebranche,
the latter and Plato being distinctly classified otherwise, be-
cause Kant rejects the hyperphysical influence of Plato and
Malebranche as much as the pre-established intellectnal har-
mony of Crusius. It suffices to affirm that the only notice-
