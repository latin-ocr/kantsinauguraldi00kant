157] KANT’S JNA UGURAL DISSERTA TION OF 1770 . 79

poreal world is virtual‚ not local, though thus improperly
talked about. Space does not contain the conditions of
possible mutual activities, except those of matter. What
may constitute the external relations of forces in immaterial
substances, as well among themselves as toward bodies, al-
together escapes the human intellect‚ as was acutely noted,
for instance, in a letter to a German prince by the clear-
sighted Euler, otherwise a great investigator and judge of
phenomena. But when people have arrived at the concept
of a highest and extra-mundane being, they are fooled by
these shadows flitting before the intellect to a degree beyond
the force of language to express. The presence of God they
figure to themselves as a local one, involving God in the
world as if also comprised in infinite space, compensating
Him for this limitation by a locality, so to speak, eminently
conceived, that is, infinite. But it is absolutely impossible
to be at the same time in several places, since different places
are mutually without each other, and hence what is in sev-
eral places is outside of itself, which implies being present to
itself externally. But as to time, having not only exempted
it from the laws of sensual knowledge, but transferred it be-
yond the limits of the world to the extra-mundane Being
Himself as a condition of His existence, they involve them-
selves in an inextricable labyrinth. Hence they cudgel their
brains with absurd questions, such as, for instance, why God
did not make the world many centuries earlier. They per-
suade themselves that it is easy to conceive, to be sure, how
God may discern what is present, that is, what is actual in
the time in wln'cla lte is, but how He may foresee what is future,
that is‚what is actual in the time ἐκ wlcz’clz He z's mayel, they
deem an intellectual difficulty3 as if the existence of the
Necessary Being descended through all the moments of an
imaginary time, and, having already exhausted a part of His
duration, saw before Him the eternity He was yet to live
