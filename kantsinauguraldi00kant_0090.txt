leading to the Kantian exclusion of empirical psychology
from metaphysics¹ is very probable.

Mendelssohn’s view of the evolutional relation of the Dis-
sertation to the Critique is precisely that which we have sug-
gested. &Vriting to Kant he says: Obviously this pamphlet
is the fruit of long meditaffion, and must be regarded as a
portion of a whole system of doctrine peculias to the author,
and of which for the present he is willing to show but few
samples. The apparent obscurity itself which has remained
in some places betrays to a practiced reader a relation to a
whole not yet presented.²

2. T lte Relatz'on of tlte Dz'ssertation to T ranscendental
Dz‘alectic

This relation to a whole is to be found in the Critique, the
Dissertation passing almost certainly through the inter-
mediate stage of a work under the title of The Boundaries of
Sensuousness and Reason,³ which was never published.

As the Dissertation was transferred almost in bulk, one has
one's choice of two methods of treatment. One may be very
elaborate or one may be very brief. The latter alternative,
of necessity, we adopt.

The relative importance of parts of the Dissertation is
stated by the author himself: The First and Fourtlg sections
may be passed over as unimportant, but the Second, Third
and Fifth, although owing to indisposition I have not gotten
them up at all satisfactorily to myself, seem to me to con-
tain a matter well worth a more careful and extensive elabo-
ration. The most general propositions regarding sensibility
play falsely a great role in metaphysics, though in the latter
the only question is of concepts and principles of pure reason.⁴
