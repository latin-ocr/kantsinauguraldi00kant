case as to composition, nor the composite in the latter case as
to totality can be thought completely in accordance with the
laws of intuition. (hztlzz‘nleable and impossible being vulgarly
deemed to have the same meaning, it is plain why the con-
cepts of the continuom as well as that of the infinite are re-l
jected by most men as concepts whose representation ac-
cording to tlte laws of intuitive cognition is impossib‘le. Al-
though Ι do not here champion these notions, especially not
the first, which are considered exploded by many schools,
still the following reminder is of the greatest moment.. Those
who use ⁴so perverse an argumentation have fallen into a
grave error.l For whatever is repugnant to the laws of the
intellect and reason is of course impossible, but that which
being the object of pure reason does merely not fall under
the laws ot intuitive cognition is not so. For here the dis-
agreement between the sensnous and the intellectnal fac-
ulties, whose natures I shall presently explain, indicates
nothing except tliat tlte abstract ideas wlaiclc tlte mind lias re-

lThose who reject the actual mathematica] infinite do not take much trouble.
'They frame a definition of the infinite from which they can shape out some con-
tradiction. lee infinite is said by them to be a quantity llum wlziclz none
greater is possible, and the mathematical infinite the multiplicity—of an assignable
unit—than which none greater is p'ossible. Having substituted greatest for infinite
they easily conclude against an infinite of their own making, as a greatest inulti-
plicity is impossib1e; or, they call an infinite niultiplicity an infinite number, and
show this to be absurd, which is plain enough, but a battle with their own fancy
only. But if they would conceive osa mathematical infinite as a quantity which
being referred to measure as unity is a multiplicity greater than all number, if,
furthermore, they would take note that mensurability here denotes only the rela-
tion to the smallness of the human intellect, to which it is given to attain to a de·
finite concept of multiplicity only by the successive addition of unit to unit, and
to the sum total called number only by going through with this progress within a
finite time, they would gain the clear insight that what does not sall in with a eer-
tain law of some subject does not on that account exceed all intellection; since an
intelleemnay exist, though not a human one, perceiving a multiplicity distinctly
by a single insight, without the successive application of measurement.
