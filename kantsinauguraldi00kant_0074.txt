fore, impossible by the vemt concept, as Wolf hastily concludcd
from the notion of a complex or multiplicity which he
deemed sufficient to a whole, as such, but only on condition
that there exist but one neccssmy cause of all things. If sev-
eral are admitted, several worlds without one another will be
possible in the strictest metaphysical sense.

Paragraph 22

If, as we validly conclude from a given world to a single
cause of all its parts, we may similarly argue reversely from
the given cause common to all to their interconnection, and
hence to the form oi the world—though Ι confess this con—
clusion does not seem as plain to me—then the primary
connection of substances will not be contingent but by the sus-
tentation of all by the common principle, necessary, and hence
the harmony proceeding from their very subsistence founded
in a common cause would proceed according to the usual
rules. Such a harmony I term established generally,· as that
which does not take place except as far as any individual
states of 3 substance are adapted to the condition of another
is harmony established particularly‚· the communion by the
former being real and physical, by the latter ideal and sym-
palhetic. All communion, then, of the substance of the uni-
verse is etcmeally established by the common cause of all, and
either established generally by physical influence—as
amended ; see paragraph 17—or adapted particularly to their
states; and the latter either rests originally in the primary
constitution of every substance or is impressed on the occa-
sion of any change whatever; the first being called pre-estab-
lished harmony, the latter occasionalism. If, then, on account
of the sustentation of all substances by one, the conjunctim
of all constituting them a unit be necessary, the universal
commerce of substances will be byphysical influence, and the
world a real whole; if not, the commerce will be sympa-
