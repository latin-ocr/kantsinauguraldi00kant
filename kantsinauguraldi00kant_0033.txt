bodily presentation, how will he explain the necessity, since
this mode of presentation has only empirical origin, which
can furnish no necessity? Passing by this requirement, let
him assume space with this property of it. No matter what
the quality of that alleged confused presentation, geometry
demonstrates to him, not by concepts hovering in the air,
but by construction of concepts, that space, and hence that
which fills it, to wit, a body, absolutely does not consist of
monads, that is, simple parts. Thus the confession is forced
that intuition, the presentation of space, for instance, on the
one hand, and conception, on the other, are modes of presen-
tation of different species. Intuition cannot by merely re-
solving the confusion of presentation be converted into con-
cepts. Exactly the same reasoning holds for the presenta-
tion of time.l

The untenableness of the Leibnitzian view becomes more
glaring when from mathematics we go on to physics. Ac-
cording to mere concepts of the understanding it is sels-con-
tradictory to think of two things as existing outside of each
other which in respect to all internal determinations of quan-
tity and quality are absolutely one and the same. It is one and
the same thing thought twice. In other words, we have nu-
merically one. This is Leibnitz’s Identity of the Indiscernible.

He attached no little importance to it. Nevertheless it
runs sharply counter to reason. For it is inconceivable why
a drop of water in one place should prevent the existence of
an exactly similar drop in some other place. This proves
immediately that things in space must not be represented by
concepts of the understanding as things in themselves, but
according to their sensual intuition as phenomena; that
space is not a quality or relation of things in themselves,
and that pure concepts os the understanding by themselves
constitute no cognition.2
