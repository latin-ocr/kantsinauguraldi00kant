his development, such a simultaneous and adversative eluci-
dation of sensualistic and rationalistic dogmatism must have
been to Kant more impressive than probably any other book.
The real difficulty one has in subscribing unconditionally
to Windelband’s assertion of specific origin is of a general
nature. When all is said, the Nouveaux Essaz's, virtual
innateness and all, is but the final development of the Leib-
nitzian Monadology. Now. the fact is, Kant could do a
good deal of developing for himself. He was thoroughly
versed in Leibnitzianism. On occasion he could write such
a Nouveaux-Essaistic passage as this: ‘⁴ No doubt the infinite
though extremely obscure perception of the whole universe
ever internally present to the soul already contains whatever
reality i‘s to be in the thoughts later to be suffused with 1
greater light. The mind from day to day acquires larger
cognition merely by turning the attention to some things,
while withdrawing from others an equal degree, thus shed-
ding an intenser light upon the former. It certainly does
not enlarge the compass of absolute reality‚ the material of
all ideas derived from its nexus with the universe remaining
the same. But what is formal, consisting in the combina-
tion of notions and the application of the attention to their
difference and agreement, is certainly changed in a variety
of ways. We make a similar observation on the inherent
force of bodies. For motions rightly considered being not
realities but phenomena, and the inherent force modified by
the impact of an external body resisting intrusion by its
inner principle of efficacy with as much power as it acquires
in the direction of the impelling body, the sum of reality in the
phenomenon of a motion of forces is equivalent to that which
from the first inhered in the quiescent body, although the inter-
nal force which when at rest is indeterminate as to direction
does not acquire direction except by an external impulse.’'¹
