harmonize as if they did influence each other. Thus origi-
nated the system of Pre-Established Harmony, the oddest
figment in philosophy, simply because everything was to be
explained by concepts.

Taking, on the contrary, the pure intuition of space as the
a priori foundation of all external relations, all substances
are connected so as to render physical influence possible.
They constitute one whole. All things in space forming the
world, and there being but one space, several worlds external
· to each other become impossible. This proposition of the
unity of the world is absolutely indemonstrable if the proof
is to be by concepts not founded upon intuition.l

We have expressly excluded the discussion of Berkeleian-
ism from this paper. But we make an exception of the fol-
lowing quotation, as it is just as applicable to Leibnitzianism:
“The thesis of all genuine Idealists, from the Eleatic School
down to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in this formula: All
cognition by sense and experience is mere seeming; only
in the ideas of the pure understanding and reason is truth.
The principle perennially ruling and determining my Ideal—
ism is, on the contrary: All cognition of things from pure
understanding or from pure reason exclusively is mere seem—
ing, and only in experience is truth.'' ²

Assigning any concept either to sensibility or to the pure
understanding, and calling the assignment its transccndmtal
place? the achievement of the Dissertation can be expressed
substantially in one sentence. It transfers a series of Leib-
nitzian concepts from their transcendental place in the pure
understanding to their transcendental place in pure intuition.
This is the foundation of the Transcendental Aesthetic.
