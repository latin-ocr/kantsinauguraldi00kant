115] KANT’S [ΝΑ UGURAL DISSERTATJON OF 1770 37

Nor is this comparison; it is argument. Kant has been
discussing the proposition: The quantity of absolute reality
in the world is naturally not changed, neither increasing nor
diminishing,¹ and the parallel we have quoted leads on to
the assertion that though the powers of spirits and their pro-
gression to higher perfections seem to be exempt from this
law, they are bound by the same.² It is worth noting that
all this appeared in the Nova Dz'lucz'datio a decade before the
Nouveaux Essaz‘s. The transmutation of Leibnitzianism by
the spatial and temporal requirements of the natural
sciences (and these sciences include psychology‚ cf. IV,
357) is precisely similar to the substitution of real for log-
ical opposition under Sufficient Cause.

This is but one illustration of the continual evolution of
Kantian from Leibnitzian ideas under the influence of mathe-
matical and nature studies. One is a little dubiouS, there-
fore, whether the universality of the phenomenon is quite
sufficiently recognized by Windelband's attempt to narrow
down the origin of the Dissertatz'on to one work oi Leibnitz.

8. Re-Survey in Conclusion

It is difficult for a man who has done good work in a
branch other than that in which his greatest successes have
lain to obtain all the recognition due to his semi-professional
achievement. We speak of Daltonism, though it was Goethe
and not Dalton who first discovered color—blindness. Simi-
larly, Kant’s Natural History and Theory of the Heavens is
dropped out of sight, and the doctrine presented by him is
connected with the name of Laplace, from the point of view
of the astronomer justly so. When, however, it is remem-
bered that Kant introduced himself to literature by Thoughts
on the Correct Estimation of Living Forces, and that prior
to the Dissertation he had written paperS, short but preg-
