163] KANT’S [NA UGURAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 85

phenomena, by as much as it is granted to it to descend
from the same principle to a greater number of consequences,
The tlzz‘rd of this kind of principles is: matter neither origin-
ales nor perz'slies,· all the changes in the world concern form
only; a postulate which on the recommendation of common
sense has spread through all philosophical schools, not be-
cause it is to be taken as having been found so, or as having
been demonstrated by arguments aptiori, but because if we
were to admit that matter itself is fleeting and transitory,
nothing at all that is stable and lasting would be left any
longer 'to serve for the explication of phenomena according
to universal and perpetual laws, and hence nothing at all
would be left for the exercise ot the intellect.

This method, especially in respect to the distinction be-
tween sensual and intellectual knowledge, which, when re-
duced by more careful investigation to exactness, will occupy
the position of a propaedeutical science, will certainly be of
unlimited benefit to all intending to penetrate into the very
recesses of metaphysics.

NOTE.—As in this last section the tracing out of the method occupies all the
space at disposal, and the rules prescribing the true form of arguing concerning
sensuous things shine by their own light and do not borrow it from the illustra-
tive examples, Ι have thrown in but a cursory mention of the latter. For this
reason it is not strange if some things should seem to have been asserted with
more audacity than truth, they certainly calling, when a broader treatment shall be
possible, for greater force of arguments. Thus, what is alleged in paragraph 27
on the locality of immaterial substances lacks an explication which, if the reader
please, may be found in Euler in the place cited, Vol. II, pp. 49, 52. For the
soul is not in communion with the body as being detained in a certain place in
the latter, but a determined place in the universe is attributed to it, for the reason
that it is in mutual commerce with some body, which commerce being dissolved
all its position in space is removed. Its locality, therefore, is derivative and con-
tingently applied to it, not primitive and a necessary condition of its existence,
because whatever things cannot by themselves be objects of external senses such
as man’s, that is, immaterial substances, are exempt altogether from the univer-
sal condition of externally sensz‘ble things, namely, space. Hence absolute and

immediate locality may be denied to the soul, while yet hypothetical and mediate
locality may be attributed to it.
