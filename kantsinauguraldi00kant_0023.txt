991 KANT’S [ΝΑ UG URAL DISSER TA TION OF 1770 2 1

natural laws of the thinking seli derived from them, we have
before us an empirical psychology, a psychology oi the in-
ternal sense, which perhaps explains its manifestations, but
can never help us to understand properties that do not fall
under experience‚ or to teach apodictically anything touch-
ing the nature of thinking beings in general.1

Kant admits that an investigation of the first efforts of our
cognitive faculty, beginning with single perceptions and ris-
ing to general concepts, is no doubt very useful; we thank
Locke for having been the first to open the way.2 But he
complains* that Locke by his ultra-experiential extension of
experiential results threw wide open the gates to mysticism,
since reason, once having authority on its side, is not to be
kept within bounds by recommendations of moderation.³
The “mysticism'’ hits at Berkeley, for in Kant’s belief all
genuine Idealism is of mystic intent, and can be of none
others* However that may be, the Categories are concepts
a priori. They are independent of experience.

Does Kant owe nothing to Locke? Through a certain
range of their intellects there is much kinship. A contem-
porary reviewer of the Critique of Pure Reason delivered
himself of the opinion: “This work is a system of the higher
Idealism.” With a sarcastic acerbity unusual in him, Kant
replies: “For goodness’ sake don⁷t say lzzglzer. As to high
towers and the metaphysically great men resembling them,
there is usually about them much wind. They are not for me.
My place is the fertile batlcos of experience.''⁵ A rejoinder
like this might as easily be Locke’s as Kant'S. Other pas-
sages may be quoted having a Lockean cast, such as the
illustrative paragraph, which was much condensed in the
second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, at the end of
