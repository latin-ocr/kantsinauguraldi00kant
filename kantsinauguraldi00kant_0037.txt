1 13] KANT’S INA UGURAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 35

Space and time, and the axioms for considering all things
under their relations, are, in respect to empirical cognitions,
and all objects of the senses, real enough, and actually con-
tain the conditions of all phenomena and empirical judg-
ments. But when something is thought of not at all as an
object of the senses, but by a general and pure concept of
the reason as a thing or substance generally, very false posi-
tions result by subjecting these things to the fundamental
concepts of sensibility. Such a propaedeutical discipline
would preserve metaphysics proper from all such admixture
of the se'nsuous.”

This last, it is submitted, is the only concept set forth inv
the letter which Kant did not alter but which in the Critique
he did expand. This epistolary utterance is a reinsistence·
on the following passage from the Dz'ssertatz'on .· “ The whole
of metaphysical method as regards the sensible and the in-
tellectual amounts in substance to the following precept:
Beware lest the principles of sensuous knowledge transgress
their proper boundaries and affect the intellectual concepts¹.
The observation that the application of this criterion to the
discrimination of principles is both easy and fertile, is amply
borne out in the Critique. In the correspondence on the
Dissertation between Kant and Lambert as well as between
Mendelssohn and Kant, the discussion turns on space and
time. Virtual innateness is not considered. Is it possible
that Kant and his correspondents both missed completely
den Nerv der Inaagnraldz‘ssertatz'on ,9

An argument which is not mentioned in the place cited
from Windelband might be alleged in favor of the Nonveazcx
Essaz's as the source of the Dz'ssertatz‘on. Besides being the
ripest development of Leibnitz's intellectual philosophy, the
Nouveanx Essaz's are a running cornmentary on Locke's
Essay Concerm'ng H mnan Understandz'ng. At that period of
