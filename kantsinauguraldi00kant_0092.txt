especially in the Critical re-adjustment of the Intelligible
World of the Dissertation.

I call all transcendental ideas as to the absolute totality in
the synthesis of phenomena cosmz'cal concepts, partly because
of the unconditioned totality upon which rests the conceptos
the cosmical universe—itself only an idea—partly, because
they refer only to the synthesis of phenomena‚ which is em-
pirical. The absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions
must produce an ideal of pure reason. This ideal is totally
different from the cosmical concept, though in a sense re-
lated to it.¹ Toward the end, we observe, the re-adjustment
is barred. We find discussed, as in the Dissertation, since
everything comprehended under phenomena is changeable,
and, therefore, conditioned in its existence, an unconditioned
member the existence of which may be considered as abso-
lutely necessary . . . . a necessary beingf' Wse are, of
course, made to know its Critical transcendental place.

These Dialectic ideas, Kant persists in instructing us, are
introduced in the interest of reason, that is, for the establish-
ment of certain principles and to introduce systematical
unity into our knowledge.⁵‘ But the Transcendental ideal is
still the archetype or Prototypon transcendentale.⁴

Phenomena and space are as emphatically as ever the
matter and the form in one and the same empirical intuition.⁵

We are again enjoined never to dispense with the exten-
sion of the empirical use of the understanding‚⁶ that is, not
to indulge lazy reason,7 though empirical arguments cannot
produce apodictic p1·oof.⁸

He still holds, the idea is quite correct which sets up the
maximum as an archetype,‘³ negations being nothing but
lz'mz'tations, which they could not be unless there were the
substratum of the unlimited, the ΑΙΙ.10
