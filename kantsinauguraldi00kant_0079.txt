155] KANT’S JNA UG URAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 77

assaying art by which we can justly estimate how much be-
longs to the sensuous and how much to the intellectual
sphere, I ’shink it necessary to go into the question more
deeply.

Here, then, is the principle of reduction for any spurious
axiom: If concerning any z'ntcllectnal concept something per-
taining to time and space relations be predicted generally, it is
not to be enonnced objectively, bnt denotes only tlze condition V
witlzont wlzz'clz tlte given concept is not knowable sensnonsly.
That such an axiom is spurious, and, if not false, at least a
rash and question-begging assertion, appears thus: the sub-
ject of the judgrnent being intellectually conceived pertains
to the object, whilst the predicate, since it contains the
determinations of space and time, pertains only to the con-
ditions of human sensuous cognition, which, not adhering of
necessity to any cognition whatsoever of the object, cannot
be enounced concerning the given intellectual concept uni-
versally. The intellect’s being so readily subject to this νγ
fallacy of subreption comes of its being deceived under the
plea of another and perfectly true rule. For vve rightly sup-
pose that tlzat wlzz'clz can be cognized by no z'ntnitz'on whatever
is utterly nntln'nlmble and hence impossible. But since we
cannot attain by any mental striving, even fictitiously‚ to any
other intuition but that according to the form of space and
time, it happens that we deem all intuition whatever impos-
sible Which is not bound by these laws, passing by the pure J
intellectual intuition exempt from the laws of the senses‚ such
as the divine, by Plato called the Idea, and hence subject all
possible given things to the sensual axioms of space and
time.
