things themselves, while the other did nothing but to pro-
duce either disorder or order in the representations ol the
former.

LeibnitZ, accordingly, compared the objects of the senses
with each other as things in general and in the understand·
ing only. He did thia-siml, so far as they are judged by the
understanding to be either identical or different. As he con-
siders their concepts only and not their place in intuition, in
which alone objects can be given, and takes no account of
the transcendental place of these concepts—whether the ob-
ject is to be counted among phenomena or among things
themselves—it could not happen otherwise than that he
should extend his principle of indiscernibility, which is valid
with regard to concepts of things in general, to objects of the
senses also (mundus phenomenon) and imagine that he thus
extended not inconsiderably our knowledge of nature. No
doubt, if Ι know a drop of water as a thing itself in all its in-
ternal determinations,I cannot allow that one is different
from the other, when their entire concepts are identical.

Secondly, the principle that realities as mere assertions
never logically contradict each other is perfectly true with
regard to the relation of concepts, but has no meaning what—
ever, either as regards nature or as regards that of which we
have no concept whatever, namely, 3 thing itself. Real oppo-
sition, as when A—B=0‚ takes place wherever two realities
being united in one subject, one reality annihilates the effect
. of the other. This is constantly brought before us in nature
by all impediments and reactions which, depending on forces,
must be called realitates plcenomena.

Thirdly, the Leibnitzian monadology has really no other
foundation than that Leibnitz represented the difference of
the internal and external in relation to the understanding
only. Substances must have something interval, which is
free from all external relations, and therefore from composi-
