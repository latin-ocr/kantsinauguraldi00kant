guise of intellectual concepts, from which spurious axioms
originate, can be reduced to three species, whose general
forniulae are the following:

1. The sensual condition under which alone the intuition
of an object is possible, is the condition of its possibility.

2. The sensual condition under which alone data can be
compared in order to sorni tlte intellectnal concept of tlte object,
is the condition of the very possibility of the object.

3. The sensual condition under which alone the subsump-
tion of an object under a given intellectnal concept is possible,
is tlte condition os tlte possibiltty of tlte oly’ect.

Paragraplc 2 7

A spurious axiom oi the first class is: Whatever is, is
somewlcere and so7neti7nc.¹ Now by this spurious principle
all beings, even though they be intellectually cognized‚ are
restricted in existence by the conditions ot space and time.
Hence people discuss all sorts of inane questions, such as
concerning the places of immaterial substances—of which,
for that very reason, there is no sensuous intuition, nor, under
that form, any representation—in the corporeal universe, or
the seat of the soul; and as they improperly mix sensual
things with intellectual concepts, like square figures with
round, it oftens happens that of the disputants one appears
as milking a lie-goat, and the other as holding the sieve
under. The presence of immaterial substances in the cor-

¹ Space and time are conceived as comprehending in them all things in any way
offered to the senses. Hence, according to the laws of the human mind, the in·
tuition of nothing is given except as contained in space and time. To this preju-
dice another may be compared which is not properly a spurious axiom but a play
of the fancy, and which may be set forth in the general formula: In whatever
exists are space and time, that is to say, every substance is extena‘ed and continu-
ously changed. But though people oi dense conception are bound firmly by this
law of imagination, even they see reaclily that it pertains only to the efforts of
fancy, shadowing forth to itself the appearance of things, not to the conditions of
existence.
