the representative state. Hence space is employed as the
type even of the concept of time itself, representing it by a
line, and its limits-moments——by points. Time, on the
other had, approaches more to a universal and rational con—
cept, comprising under its relations all things whatsoever‚ to
wit, space itself, and besides, those accidents which are not
comprehended in the relations of space, such as the thoughts
of the soul. Again, time, besides this, though it certainly
does not dictate the laws os reason, yet constz'tntes the princi-
pal condz'tions under favor of wlzz'clz tlte mind compares its
notz'ons according to tlte laws of reason. Thus, I cannot judge
what is impossible except by predicating a and not-a of the
same subject at tlze same time. And especially, considering
experience, though the reference of cause to effect in external
objects were to lack the relations of space, still in all things,
external or internal, the mind could by the auxiliary relation
of time alone be informed which is the first and which latter
or caused. And even the quantity of space itself cannot be
rendered intelligible unless, referring it to measure as to a
unity, we set it forth in number, which itself is but multiplic-
ity distinctly cognized by numeration, that is, by the succes-
sive addition of one to one in a given time.

Lastly, the question will arise in any one as if spontan-
eously, whether either concept be connate or acqnired. The
latter by what has been shown seems* refuted already, but
the former, smoothing the way for laey philosophy, declaring
vain by the citing of a first cause any further quest, is not to
be admitted thus rashly. But beyond doubt cz'tlzer concept z's
aeqnired, not, it is true, abstracted from the sense of objects,
for sensation gives the matter not the form of human cog-
nition, but from the very action of the mind eo-ordinating
its sense-percepts in accordance with perpetual laws, as
though an immutable type, and hence to be known intui-
tively. For sensations excite this act of the mind but do not
