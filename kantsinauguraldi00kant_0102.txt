100 KANT’S [NA ζ] G (IRA l, DISSER ΤΛ ΤΙΟΝ OF 1770 [ 1 78

ity not merely from the general concept of the nature of a
spirit, which is all too hypotlietical, but from some actual
and universally conceded observation. Presuming upon the
reader's indulgence,I insert an attempt of the kind, some-
what out of my way, to be sure, and far from a demonstra-
tion,but nevertheless giving occasion, it seems to me, for not
unpleasant surmises.

This intercalation¹ is very much in the nature of a Scho-
lium, would gladden the heart of a Swedenborgian as much
as this scholium would that of a iollower of a Malebranche,
ends in as retractive a manner as the scholium, and to com-

think, the scholium is by Windelband. Kant’s reply to the
former will answer the latter 35 well: “My attempt at an
analogy is not really a serious opinion oi mine, but an ex-

scholium itself.

Really, Windelband's—as the instance of Mendelssohn
shows, far from unnatural—misunderstanding of an incidental
exhibition of a Kantian peculiarity would not require to be
mentioned if it were not part of that meritorious author's
argument for relegating the Dissertation to the Pte-Critical
period of Kant.

On this point, the following passage in a letter from Kant
to his editor, Tieftrunk‚³‘ seems to us to put Windelband at
issue with Kant himself: “I assent with pleasure to your
proposal for collecting and editing my minor writings. Only
I wish you would not include writings older than 1770. In
this case, a German translation of my Inaugural Dz'ssertation
