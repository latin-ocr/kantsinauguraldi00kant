ΟΝ THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FORM OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD

Paragraplc 13

The principle of the form of a universe is that which con-
tains the cause of the universal tie by means of which all
substances and their states pertain to one which is called a
world. The principle of the form of the sensz'ble world is
that which contains the cause of the universal tie of all things
regarded as plzenomena. The form of the z’ntellz'gz'ble world
acknowledges an objective principle, that is, some cause by
which it is the colligation of what exists in it. But the world
regarded as phenomenon, that is, in respect to the sensibility
of the human mind, acknowledges no principle of form but
3 subjective one, that is, 3 certain mental law by which it is
necessary that all things qualified for being objects of the
senses would seem to pertain necessarily to the same whole.
Whatever be, therefore, the principle of the form of the sen-
511316 world, it will comprise only actual things in as far 35
thought of 35 possibly falling under sense-percqotz'on,· hence
neither immaterial substances, which as such are excluded
by definition from the external senses altogether, nor the
cause of the world, which, since by it the mind exists and
has the power of sense-perception, cannot be the object of
the senseS. These formal principles of the plcenomenal uni-
verse which are absolutely primary, universal, and, so to
speak, the outlines and conditions of anything else wh'atso-
ever in human sensuous cognition‚I shall now show to be
two: time and space.
