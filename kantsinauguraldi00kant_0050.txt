ing independently of each other are mutually related as '

consequences, which principle being abandoned, the possi-
bility of transitive force in a world is an illicit assumption.
And, furthermore, this form csscntz’al to the world is on that
account immutable, and exposed to no vicissitude whatever.
It is so in the first place for a logical reason, since any
change supposes the identity of the subject with determina-
tions succeeding one another in turn. Hence the world,
remaining the same world through all the states succeeding
one another, preserves the same fundamental form. For it
does not suffice to the identity of the whole that all the parts
be identical, the identity of characteristic composition is re-
quired also. But it follows especially from a real cause. For
the nature of the world, which is the primary inner principle
of whatever variable determinations may pertain to its state,
never by any possibility being opposite to itself, is naturally,
that is, by itself, immutable ‚⁴shence there is given in any
world whatever some form ascribable to its nature, constant
and invariable, as the perennial principle of any contingent
and transitory form pertaining to the state of the world.

{1⁴ They who hold this disquisition superfluous are confuted by

the concepts oi space and time, conditions, as it were, given
by their very own selves and primitive, by whose aid, that is
to say, without any other principle, it is not only possible
but necessary for several actual things to be regarded as re—
ciprocally parts constituting a whole. But I shall show
presently that these are plainly not rational notions‚ nor the
bonds which they form objective ideas, but phenomena; and
that though they witness, to be sure, some principle which is
the common universal bond, it is not set forth by thern.

III. Universalz‘cy, which is the absolute allness os the apper-
taining parts. For, regard being had to any given composite,
'though it may be besides a part of another, still there always
obtains a certain comparative allness, 'namely, that of the
