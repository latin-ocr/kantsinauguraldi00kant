world. We do not herc consider the world, let it be under-
stood, as to matter, that is, as to the nature of the sub-
stances of which it consists, whether they be material or
immaterial, but as to form, that is to say, how among sev-
eral things taken separately a connection, and among them
all, totality can have place.

Paragraplc J 7

Several substances being given, the principle of their pos-
sible intercommnnication is not apparent from tlteir existence
solely, but something else is required besides from which
their mutual relations may be understood. For on account
of mere existence they are not necessarily related to any-
thing, unless it be to their cause3 but the relation of an
effect to the cause is not intercommunication, but depend-
ence. Therefore, if any commerce intervenes among them,
there is need of an exactly determining specific reason.

The sham cause in plzysz'cal influence consists in rashly as-
suming that the commerce of substance and transitive forces
is sufficicntly knowable from their mere existence. Hence
it is not so much a system as rather the neglect of all philo-
sophical system as a superfluity in the argument. Freeing
the concept from this defect, we shall have a species oi corn-
merce alone deserving to be called real, and from which the

Ἴ whole constituting the world merits being called real, and

not ideal or imaginary.

Paragraplz 18

Α whole from necessary substances is impossible. For,
since the existence of each stands for itself without depend-
ence on any other, a dependence which in necessary sub-
stances clearly cannot befall, it is plain that not only does
the intercommunication of substances (that is, the reciprocal
dependence of their states) not follow from their existence,
but as necessary substances cannot belong to them at all.
