143] KANT’S INAUGURAL DISSERTATJON OF 1770 65

external sense can be clear and perspicuous unless by
means of that intuition which it is the business of geometry .
to contemplate. Besides, this science does not demonstrate

its universal propositions by thinking the object through the γ ⁸·

universal concept, as is done in intellectual disquisition, but
by submitting it to the eyes in a single intuition, as is done
in matters of sense.¹

D. Spaee z‘s not something objectz've and real, neither sub-
stance, nor accident, nor relation3 but subjective and ideal,
arising by fixed law from the nature of the mind like an out-
line for the mutual co-ordination of all external sensations
whatsoever. Those who defend the reality of space either
conceive of it as an absolute and immense receptacle of possi—
ble things, an opinion which, besides the English, pleases
most geometricians, or they contend forits being the rela—
tion of existing things ilself, which clearly vanishes in the
removal of things and is thinkable only in actual things, as
besides LeibnitZ, is maintained by most of our countrymen.
The first inane fiction of the reason, imagining true infinite
relation without any mutually related things, pertains to the
world of sable. But the adherents of the second opinion fall
into a much worse error. Whilst the former only cast an
obstacle in the way of some rational or noumenal concepts,
otherwise most recondite, such as questions concerning the
spiritual world, omnipresence‚ etc., the latter place them-
selves in fiat opposition to the very phenomena, and to the -
most faithful interpreter of all phenomena, to geometry.

lAs the necessity of conceiving space as a continuous quantity is easy to de-
monstrate, I pass it by. It is a consequence from this that t'he simple in space is
not a part, but a limit. A limit generally, is that in a continuous quantity which
contains the limited portion* Space not the limit of another is a solid. The
limit of a solid is a surface, of a surface the line, of a line the point; hence there
are three kinds of limits in space, as there are three dimensions. Two of these
limits, the surfaee and the line, are themselves spaces. The concept of limit
enters into no quantity besides time and space.
