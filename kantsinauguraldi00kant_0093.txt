169] KANT’S JNAUGURAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 91

Still, once more, we must not on that ground cease to em-
ploy the subordinate faculty for imparting logical form to any
given knowledge, the faculty by which the cognitions of the
understanding are arranged among themselves only, lower
rules under higher, the condition of the latter comprehend-
ing the condition of the former, as far as all this can be done
through comparison.¹

It is impossible to allow transcendental hypotheses in the
speculative employment of reason, or the use of hyperphys-
sical instead of physical explanations; and again on the Dis-
sertational ground, because reason is thus not in the least
advanced.·-'

In the Critique not less than in the Dissertation, there
would be no excuse if reason were to surrender a causality
which it knows, and have recourse to obscure indemonstrable
principles of explanation, which it cloes not know.3

We have two expressions, world and nature, which fre-
quently run into each other. The first denotes the mathe-
matical total of phenomena and the totality of their syn-
thesis, either by composition or division. The world, how-
ever, is called nature if we look upon it as adynamical whole,
and consider not the aggregation of space and time, which pro-
duces quantity, but the unity in the existence of phenomena⁴

It might be supposed that this is only an economical trick
of the reason for the purpose of saving itself trouble, a purely
hypothetical attempt which, if successful, would impart by
that very unity a certain amount of probability to the pre-
supposed principle of explanation. Such a selfish purpose,
however, can easily be distinguished from the idea accord—
ing to which we all presuppose that this unity of reason
agrees with nature, and that in this case reason does not
beg but bids, although we may be quite unable, as yet, to
determine the limits of that unitys'*
