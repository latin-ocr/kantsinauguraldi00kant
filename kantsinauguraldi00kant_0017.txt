93] KANT'S [NA UGURAL DISSERTA TION OF 1770 15

Only in experience is truth31 hence the need of a sensible,
uninterfered with by the intelligible world.

If we are to have no such interierence, all phenomena
must exist in one nature. Without such unity a priori, no
unity of experience, and therefore no determination of
objects in experience, would be possiblest' Nature, in the
empirical sense of the word, means the coherence of
phenomena in their existence, according to necessary laws⁸
Experience, and therefore the objects oi experience, would
be impossible without causal connecffionf The determining
an occurrence in time, that is, the occurrence itself as per-
taining to experience, would be impossible did it not fall
under such a dynamic rule. By determining by means of
the law of causality an object corresponding to a concept, a
represented occurrence has objective validity, or, in a word,
truth.5 But in time nothing can determine anything else,
except it be the cause of the latter's determinations.⁶

But will not Hume’s habitual association do as a definition
of cause ?—Kant thinks not. The semblance of a conviction,
based on subjective association and mistaken for the percep-
tion οἱ a natural affinity, cannot balance the misgivings justly
roused by such bold proceedings. The proofs, like streams
that have broken their banks, run wildly across the fields
wherever the inclination of some hidden association may
chance to lead them. We must show the possibility of ar-
riving synthetically and a priori at a certain knowledge of
things not contained in the concept of the thing.T

The usual assumption is that our knowledge must conform
to the object. On this supposition‚ any attempt to settle
anything concerning an object by a priori concepts intended
to enlarge our experience suffers shipwreck. Let us try
