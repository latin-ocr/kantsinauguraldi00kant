INTRODUCTION

J. Summary of Kant’s critical Development

LICHTENBERG classified man as an Ursaclzentlcz'er, a cause-
seeking animal. This appetite for causes was analyzed by
Hume into 3 habit of association. Disregarding the Associ-
ationists and the Scottish school of philosophy, Hume's
lasting influence on the history of philosophy arose from
his becoming the metaphysical conscience of Kant. The
whole development dates back to Locke. Locke's philos-
ophy, to quote Kant, was 3 noogony or, as he elsewhere puts
it, a physiology of the understanding.

In 3 less Baconian direction, continental Cartesianism
emulated mathematics in the effort to arrive at apodictic
certainty through deductive dogmatism. Leibnitz, formu-
lated by Wolff, became dominant in Germany. Kant's pre-
critical metaphysics is, therefore, substantially Leibnitzian.
