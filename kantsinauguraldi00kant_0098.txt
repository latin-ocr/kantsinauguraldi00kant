tion. The simple, therefore, the uncmnpounded, is the
foundation of the internal, of things themselves. The inter-
nal in substances cannot consist in space, form, contact, or
motion, all these determinations being external relations.
We cannot, therefore, ascribe to substances any internal
state but that which belongs to our own internal sense,
namely, the state of representation& This is the history of
the monads which were to form the elements of the whole
universe, and the energy of which consists in representations
only, so that properly only within themselves can they be
active.

For this reason, the principle of a possible community of
substances could only be a pre-established harmony, not a
physical influence.

Fourthly, Leibnitz’s celebrated doctrine of space and
time, in which he intellectualized these forms of sensibility,
arose entirely from the same delusion of transcendental re-
flection. If by the pure understanding alone Ι want to re-
present the external relations of things, I can do this only by
means of the concept of their reciprocal action3 if Ι want to
connect one state with another state of the same thing, this
is possible only in the order of cause and effect. Thus it
happened that Leibnitz conceived space as a certain order
in the community of substances, and time as the dynamical
sequence of their states.

That which space and time seem to possess as proper to
themselves and independent of things, he ascribed to the
confusion of these concepts, which made us mistake what is
a mere form of dynamical relations for a peculiar and inde-
pendent intuition, antecedent to things themselves. Thus
space and time became with him the intelligible form of the
connection of things themselves, namely of substances and
their states, all things being intelligible substances (substan—
tiae noumena). Nevertheless, he tried to make these con-
