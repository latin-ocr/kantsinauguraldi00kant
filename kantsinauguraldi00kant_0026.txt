ing that anything can be so qualified that by positing it “
something else is posited necessarily. He proved that it is l
wholly impossible ior reason to think such a connection a
priori from concepts. He inferred that in the concept of
causality reason is completely seli-deceived, certain presen-
tations having been brought by imagination and experience
under the Law of Association, and the subjective necessity
thence arising having been palmed off for objective. Hence
he concluded that reason has no faculty to think such con-

so, its concepts would be mere fictions, and its pretended a
priori cognitions nothing but common experience with a false
hall-mark. This was as much as to say: There is no such
thing as metaphysics, and there can be none. The conclu-
sion, though hasty and incorrect, was at least founded on
investigation.

It is impossible to see without a degree of pain how the
point of the problem was completely missed by his oppo-
nents, Reid, oswald, Beattie, and finally Priestley. In order
to satisfy the problem, his opponents would have had to
penetrate very deeply into the nature of reason, as far as ex-
elusively occupied with pure thought, That did not suit
them. Consequently they invented the commodious way of
braving it out by an appeal to Common Sense. Common
Sense is a great gift of heaven, but to appeal to it as an
oracle when insight and science have run down to heel—taps
is a subtile invention for enabling the shallowest babbler
bravely to engage and hold out with the profoundest mind.
The appeal is nothing but an appeal to the judgment oi the
crowd. I should fancy Hume's claim to common sense was
as good as Beattie's, and besides he could claim something
that Beattie did not possess, to wit, critical reason.
