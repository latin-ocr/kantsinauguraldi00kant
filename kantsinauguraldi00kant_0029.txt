105] KANT’S JNA UGURAL DISSER TA TION OF 1770 27

the process of developing this portion of the Dissertation
into the Transcendental Logic, Hume was overturned by the
deduction of the Categories. This, together with the
schematism of the understanding and thev synthesis of the

telligible world upon the Sensible World answers for what
difference there is between the Transcendental Aesthetic and
the corresponding part of the Dissertation.

the Critique. This synthesis of the spontaneous unity of
apperception is the pervading motor force of the Critique.
It is literally the vital principle. It makes the Critique what
it is, and what the Dz'sserlation is not. Being an all-pervad-
ing principle, no one quotation can show its force. The
