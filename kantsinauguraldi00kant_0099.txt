to sensibility any independent kind of intuition, but ascribed
all, even the empirica] representation of objects, to the un—
derstanding‚ leaving to the senses nothing but the contempt-

of all conclusions with, regard to objects compared with each
other in the understanding only, and that it confirms at the
same time what we have so strongly insisted on, namely, that
phenomena, though they cannot be comprehended as things
themselves among the objects of the pure understanding, are,
nevertheless, the only objects in which our knowledge can
possess objective reality, i. e.‚ where intuition corresponds to
concept&

If this Kantian account of the difference between Criticism
and Leibnitzianism is not, within the limits we have assigned,
applicable to the Dissertation, we are mistaken.

nitely settled.

After all, are we right in taking the Dissertation for the
turning-point?

Is we are not, then the turning—point falls somewhere
