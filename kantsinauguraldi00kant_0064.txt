observed in motion or some series of inner changes, whereby
plainly all certitutle of rulcs is abolished. 'I'hat we can
estimato the quantity of time only in the concrete, namely,
either by motion or by a series of tlcoz,1glzts,arises from the
concept ol time resting only on an inherent mental law, it
not being a connate intuition; whence the act of the mind
co—ordinating the impressions is elicited only by the aid of
the senses. So far from its being possible to deduce and
explain the concept of time from some other source by force
of reason, it is presupposed by the very principle of contra-
diction, it underlies it by way of condition. For a and not-a
are not repugnant unless thought of the same tlcz'ng simul-
taneously, that is, at the same time, they may belong to the
same thing after each other, at different times. Hence the
possibility of changes is not thinkable except in time. Time
is not thinkable by changes, but reversely.¹

6. But although time posited in itself and absolutely be an
imaginary thing, yet as appertaining to the immutable law of
sensible things as such, it is a perfectly true concept, and the
patent condition of intuitive representation throughout all the
infinite range of possible sense-objects. For since simultan-
eous things as such cannot be placed before the senses but
by the aid ol time, and since changes are unthinkable except
by time, it is obvious that this concept contains the univer-

¹ Simultaneous facts are not such for the reason that they do not succeed each
other. Reinoving succession, to be sure, a conjunction is withdrawn which ex·
isted by the time-„series Yet thence does not originate another true relation, the
coniunctiori of all things in the same moment. For simultaneous things are
joined in the same moment of time exactly as successive things are joined in dif-
ferent moments. Hence, though time is of but one dimension‚ still the ubiquity
of time, to speak with Newton, by which all things sensuously thinkable are
some time, adds to the quantity of actual things another dimension, inasmuch as
they hang, so to speak, on the same point of time. For designating time by a
straight line produced infinitely, and the simultaneous things at any point of time
whatever by lines applied in succession, the surface thus generated will represent
the phenomenal world, both as to substance and aecidents.
