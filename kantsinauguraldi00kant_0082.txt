simultaneously with the present events of the world. All

The prejudices oi the second species, since they impose
upon the intellect by the sensual conditions restricting the
mind if it wishes in certain cases to attain to what is intel-
lectual, lurk more deeply. One of them is that which
affects knowledge of quantity, the other that affecting know-
ledge oi qualities generally. The former is: every actual
multzplz'cz'ty can be given nmnerically, and hence, every infinite
quantity ; the latter, whatever z's impossible contradicts itsels.
In either of them the concept of time, it is true, does not
enter into the very notion of the predicate, nor is it attributed
as a qualification to the subject. But yet it serves as a
means for forming an idea of the predicate, and thus, being
a condition, affects the intellectual concept of the subject to
the extent that the latter is only attained by its aid.

As to the first, as every quantity and any series whatever
are distinctly known only by successive co—ordination. the
intellectual concept of amount and multiplicity arises only
by the aid of this concept of time, and never attains to corn-
pleteness unless the synthesis can be gone through with in
finite time. It is hence that the infinite series of co-ordinate
things cannot be comprehended distinctly according to the
limits os our intellect; it hence by the fallacy of subreption
seems impossible. According to the laws of pure intellect
any series of effects has its principle, that is, there is not
given in a series of effects a regress without a limit; whilst
according to sensual laws any series of co-ordinate things
has its assignable beginning. These propositions, the latter
of which involves the mensnrability of the series, the former
the dependence of the whole, are taken hastily for identical.
