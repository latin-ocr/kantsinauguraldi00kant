symbolica! cognition, and intellection is granted 115 only by
universal concepts in the abstract, not by the concrete singu-
lar. For all intuition is restricted by some principle of form
under which alone anything can be discerned by the mind
immediately or as singular, and not merely conceived dis-
cursively by general concepts, This formal principle of our

intuition—space and time—is the condition under which

something can be an object of our senses, and hence as a
condition of sensuous knowledge is not a medium for intel-
lectual intuition. Resides, all the material of our cognition
is given only by the senses, but the noumenon, as such, is
not conceivable by representations drawn from sensations;
hence the intellectual concept, as such, is destitute of all
data of human intuition. For the intuition of our mind is
always passive, and therefore possible only to the extent to

, which something can affect our senses. But the divine in-

tuition, the cause—not the consequence, of objects, being
independent, is the archetype, and hence perfectly intel-
lectual.
paragraph II

But although phenomena are properly the appearances of
things, but not ideas, or express the inner and absolute
quality of objects, their cognition is nevertheless os the truest.
For 111 1116 first place, being apprehended sensual concepts,
they, being consequences, witness the presence of the object,
contrary to Idealism3 and as regards judgments concerning
that which is sensuously known, since truth in judging con-
sists in the agreement of the predicate with the given subject,
and since the concept of the subject as a phenomenon is
given only by relation to the sensuous cognitive faculty, the
sensuously observable predicates being given according to
the same, it is plain that the representations of subject and
predicate are made according to common laws, and hence
give occasion for perfectly true cognition.
