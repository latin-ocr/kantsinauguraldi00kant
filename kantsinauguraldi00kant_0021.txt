97] KANT’S JNA UG URAL DISSERTA TJON OF 1770 19

Having made time and space forms of human intuition,
and the Categories‚ or pure concepts of the understanding,
functions of the ‘⁵ unity of apperception,’' Kant relegates to the
Dialectics of Pure Reason the ideas relating to God, universe
and soul. They are regulative, not constitutive. The Criti-
cal System is based upon the thesis: The speculative use of

reason does not reach beyond the objects of possible exper-
iencest

We have outlined the Critical System. The cantion is not
amiss that this outline lays no claim to completeness. For
instance, Kant is responsible for much demolition and re-
fashioning of Aristotelian logie. Outside of the Baconian
rebellion, his attempt is the first attended with important
and lasting consequences. Our dealings with the Critique
are limited by a special purpose. This outline, besides, is
merely for preliminary orientation. At this moment we are
content to have shown that Kant, trained in natural science
and mathematics, primarily under Newton‚ and dissatisfied
with the psychogenetic philosophy of Locke, as well as with
the rationalistic metaphysics of Leibnitz‚ mainly because he
understood as none before him the force of Hume's argu—
ment, made the attempt to pilot human reason between the
two rocks of mysticism and skepticism.·' He set aside the
noumenal or intelligible world to Praetical Reason, whilst as-
signing to speculative reason the definite limits of exper—
ience. He wished to keep open to human reason its entire
field os activity in the division suited to its purposesffq

2. Kant and Locke

One principle is of fundamental importance to understand-
ing Kant. The Critique is a treatise on metaphysics. It is
not a treatise on psychology. It considers not the origin
