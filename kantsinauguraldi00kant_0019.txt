95] KANT’S JNAUGURAL DISSERTA TION OF1770 17

The reply of Kant to Hume, in which the Konigsberg
philosopher makes causality a “ function of the understand-
ing” is of the profoundest significance. The proclamation
of the human mind as the law-giver of nature marks a turn-
ing-point in the whole history of metaphysics. Kant was
the first who dared say: it may sound exaggerated and
absurd to say that the understanding is the source both of
the laws and of the unity of nature. It is correct neverthe-
less, and accords with experience.¹ It is like the thought of
Copernicus, who, finding the explanation of the heavenly
motions proceeded poorly on the assumption of the whole
host of stars turning around the spectator, made trial of
better success by turning the spectator and leaving the stars
at rest.'·’

The thought is of Leibnitzian genealogy. Lockean sen-
sualism subscribed the scholastic Nilzil est in intellecta qnod
non fuerit in sensu. It was Leibnitz who added: Nisi in-
tellectus ipse? in a sense very different from Cartesian
Dualism.

However, Kant puts in as strong an anti-Leibnitzian in-
gredient. It would vitiate his concepts of sensibility and
phenomena and render his doctrine useless and empty if he
were to accept the Leibnitz-Wolffian view that our whole
sensibility is but a confused representation of things, con-
taining what belongs to them under an accumulation of
qualities and partial concepts‚ which we do not consciously
disentangle. The distinction between confused and well-
ordered concepts‚ he objects, is logical only. It does not
touch the contents of our knowledge. By thus representing
the difference between the sensible and the intelligible as
orrly logical, the Leibnitz-NVolffian philosophy gave a wrong
direction to all investigation into the nature and origin os
our knowledge. That difference, according to Kant, is in
