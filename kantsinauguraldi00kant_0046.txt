by a distinct intuition. The former is done through the
class concept by composition, as several things are contained
either under it or mutually, and hence by intellectual and
universal ideas. The latter rests on the conditious of time,
inasmuch as the concept of a composite is possible genet-
ically, that is by synthesis, by the successive union of part
to part, and falls under the laws of intuition. Similarly, a
substantial composite being given, we easily attain to the
idea of the simple parts by the general removal of the intel-
lectual notion of composition ,· for what remains after the
removal of conjunction are the simple parts. But according
to the laws of intuitive cognition this is not done, that is, all
composition is not removed, except by a regress from the
given whole to any possible parts whatsoever—in other words,
by an analysis again resting on the condition of time.¹ But
since in order to a composite a multiplicity, in order to a
whole, the allness, of parts is required, neither the analysis
nor the synthesis will be complete; hence neither by the
former will the concept of the simple part emerge, nor by the
latter the concept of the wlcole, unless either can be gone
through within a time that is finite and assignable.

But since in a continuozts quantity the regress from the
whole to assignable parts, and in an infinite quantity the pro-
gress from the parts to the given whole are endless, complete
analysis in the one and complete synthesis in the other di-
rection are impossible; hence neither the whole in the first

¹ To the words analysis and synthesis a two-told meaning is commonly given;
for the synthesis is either qualitative, a progress in a series of subordinates from
the reason to the consequenceJ or quantitative, a progress in a series of co-
ordinates from the given part through its complements to the whole. Similarly,
analysis, taken in the first sense, is a regress from tlte consequence to tlte reason,
but in the latter meaning a regress from a whole to its possible or mediate parts,
that is, to the parts of parts 3 hence it is not a division but a subdivisz'on of the
given composite. Synthesis as well as analysis are here taken only in the latter
sense.
