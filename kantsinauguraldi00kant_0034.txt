The trouble throughout is, we see, that Leibnitz did not
recognize a priori intuition as a principle at all. He intel-
lectualized it by converting it into confused concepts. This
absence oi an intuitional principle was the reason why he
held to be impossible what could not be represented by pure
concepts of the understanding. His principle of sufficient
Cause, a priori intuition being dispensed with, and the rep-
resentation of the principle being thus reduced to mere a
priori concepts, produced the consequence that all things
considered metaphysically are reality and negation, being
and non-being. According to him, pain would have for its
reason only an absence of pleasure, vice absence of virtuous
impulses, and the rest oi a body only the absence of moving
force. He failed to consider that in intuition, in space, for
instance, one reality, namely, a motor force, may be opposed
to another reality, namely, a motor force in the contrary
direction, while quite analogously, in internal intuition, real
motives may be opposed in the same subject. Thus Leib-
nitz originated the principle, obnoxious to sound sense and
even to morality, that all evil considered as cause is equal to
zero. His Sufficient Cause, being posited in mere concepts,
did not render the slightest assistance in going beyond
analytical judgments.

His system of Pre-Established Harmony, though really
intended to explain the communion between the soul and
the body, had to be directed, to begin with, to the general
explanation of the communion of substances, by virtue of
which they constitute one whole. Substances, by the very
concept, must be represented as completely isolated. If
they are to be mundane substances‚ their community must
be purely ideal, and cannot be real physical influence. The
originator of their existence must be assumed an artist who
has arranged these completely isolated substances so as to
