Newton caused a methodical change in the youthful meta-
physics of Kant. From propounding the Theory of the
Hem-cns, that was wrought out by Laplace, Kant went on
into geographica] and geological studies, anticipating often
modern views. From the dwelling-place of man his re-
flection was led to anthropology. Then carne the era of the
Rights of Man. We have Kant's verdict: “Rousseau has
set me right.”

Uniting these influences with a Christian education
“than which none better was imaginable‚” set Kant the
scientist, deeming causality “a mental law which under no
circumstances is it permitted to desert, and from which no
phenomenon must be excepted‚’' at variance with Kant the
moralist, destined to preach to the world the Categorical
Imperative of duty, with its implications of freedom and per-
sonal responsibility. If phenornena are things in them-
selves, freedorn cannot be saved.¹ But, for moral actions,
freedom must be saved. Hence the necessity for Kant of
both a Sensible and an Intelligible world.

without freedom is impossible the entire practical
philosophy of Kant. He terms practical whatever is pos-
sible through freedom.² He needs, therefore, an intelligible,
ἰ. e. moral, world.³

But all our knowledge begins with the senses‚* In fact, all
cognition of which man is capable is sensuous. Our knowl-
edge of objects of sense through connected perceptions is
experience.·'' Theretore, in point of time, knowledge does
not precede experience.⁶ Our theoretical knowledge, in-
cluding under sense the inner and the external senses‚ never
transcends the field of experience.⁷ There is but one ex—
perienoe, just as there is only one space and only one time.⁶
