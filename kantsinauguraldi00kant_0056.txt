knowledge, geometry3 the latter, in the organon oi all intel-
lectual concepts, mclaplcysz'cs. It is evident how much toil
the latter is expending to dispel the fogs of confusion darken-
ing the common intellect, though not always with the happy
success of the former science. Nevertheless, any cognition
retains the marks of its origin, the former, however distinct,
being called by genesis sensuous; the latter, no matter how
confused, remaining intellectual, as for instance, the moral
concepts‚ which are known not experientially but by the
pure intellect itself. The writer {ears that Wolf by the dis-
tinction between the sensuous and the intellectual‚ which to
him is only logical, checked, perhaps wholly, and to the
great detriment of philosophy, that noble enterprise of anti-
quity of discussing the nature of phenomena and noumena,
turning us from the investigation of these to what are fre-

The primary philosophy containing the principles of the
use of pure z'ntellect is metaphysics. But there is a science
propaedeutz'cal to it, showing the distinction of sensuous cog-
nition from intellectual, a specimen of which we present in
this dissertation. Empirical principles not being found in
metaphysics, the concepts to be met with in it are not then to
be sought for in the senses, but in the very nature of pure
intellect3 not as connate notions, but as abstracted from laws
whose seat is in the mind, by attending to the actions of the
mind on the occasion of experience, and hence as afqgfflth
Of this species are possibility, existence, necessity, substance,
cause, etc.. with their opposites and correlates, which, never
entering as parts into any sensual representation, can by no
means have been abstracted thence.
