series—namely, of states—as a part to the mundane wholss;
for modifications are not parts, but conseqztences of the sub-
ject. Finally, as to the nature of the substances constituting
the world, Ι have not here called into debate whether they
be contingent or necessary, nor do Ι hide such a determina—
tion unproved in the de'finition in order subsequently, as is
sometimes done, to draw it thence by some specious argu-
mentation. But Ι shall show further on that their contin-
gency can be amply concluded from the conditions here
posited.

II. Form, which consists in the co-ordz'nalz'on of the sub-
stances, not in their subordination. For co-ordz'nates are to
be regarded as mutual complements to a whole, subordinat&
as effect and cause, or generally, as principle and conse-
quence. The former relation is reciprocal and lzovwnymozcs,
any correlate in respect to any other being considered as at
once determining and determined. The latter is heterony-
mons,· on the one hand dependence only, casuality on the
other. This co-ordination is conceived as real and objective,
not as ideal, and resting in the mere pleasure of a subject
making up a whole by the summation of any multiplicity
whatever. For the grasping of several things can by no
contrivance be made a wlzole of representation, nor, for that
reason, a representation os tlce wglcole. Theretore, if there be
any totals of substances connected by no bond, a grasping
of them together, the mind forcing the multiplicity into ideal
oneneSS, will be called nothing more than a plurality of
worlds comprehended in a single thought. But the connec-
tion constituting the esscntz'al form of a world is looked upon
as the principle of the possible influences of the substances
composing that world. For an actual influence pertains not
to essence butt-to state, and the transitive forces, the causes
of the influences, suppose some principle by which it is pos-
sible that the states of several things in other respects exist*
